It's up to the customer to support their income because the restaurants don't have to.  I certainly hope more states adopt this. \n\nI live in Kentucky, so the rules are different here.

The cost of the food is higher, but the waiters are guaranteed either a base pay or a percentage of sales, whichever is higher.

I'm not a fan of Shiny Malamar, I prefer it's non-Shiny color. I'll only get a Robin Amiibo if they make a female version.  Naw.  Thanks. Naw. I just find the male one weird. ...huh? Ehh.

My first battle with my Mono Psychic-type Team on Showdown is going pretty well... Now only if my opponent will respond back... ._. ? Showdown Monotype battle, anyone? What set did you give them? Cuz I love the concept of having psychic powers.  What room are you in? And what's your Showdown name? :( Did you EV train them? What natures are they? What level are they? Sure. *Sighs* Fine. Are we registered? Damn it. For some reason, it won't let me get to the chatrooms. Then get online. Nvm, my teams keep getting deleted anyway... ._. GET ONLINE. How do I not do that. :| Ready? srry Lvl 100? XD Lvl 100? XD Damn. Well, thanks a lot. I see you EV trained the Espeon. I do Showdown from my Wii U. Jaques? Can you pls rename it Gallade? Can you please re-name it Gallade? I don't really like nicknames. I'll give you a Shiny if you do. :| ...Fine. Why the fuck did you name it Jaques anyway? Btw, mind if I borrow you're 6IV Ditto once more later? Whelp. Ok, give me a few minutes. And I don't need the Ditto right away, I still need to get an Adamant/Jolly HA male Ralts first. Do you happen to have a female Buneary I can use for breeding it? I only have a single male one. Yeah, I'm gonna use my Meinshao as the donor. I'm gonna get online now. And ok, but I can't use the Ditto yet. I still need to get a HA Jolly/Adamant Ralts. I won't have the Ralts by then. Just trade me the Buneary. Ehh, I'll let you know when I need it. Like I said, it's fine. I mean, if you really want to lend it to me, than sure. Chubby?

Attack Stat Einstein didn't live to see Pok\u00e9mon. :D :) ? How the fuck did I get involved in this? While we're playing flair change, can someone give me a regular Malamar flair? Ikr. Ehh. lolno Says the one who was changing people's flairs by himself. :| How was I suppose to know? I'm not a mod. Not really. *Shrugs* And how come only Patrick can change the flairs into one that isn't currently here? And everyone's messing with the Sky Kid community why? Ehh. What I meant was if he was ready to trade the Jirachi yet. :/ Don't confuse my friends for you. And I don't see why you should be bothering with them. They didn't do anything to you. No. In all of this expansive universe, there is no place that trolling is OP. Or anything good, in that matter. They didn't do anything to you. You don't have a mere, pathetic, little right to commit harm unto them. And trolling on the internet can lead to real life affects. Caling the cops to track the asshole down because of cyber bullying has happened before, and it's undoubtedly going to happe again.  You're the one who decided to be a little bitch. You're doing it directly. My point still stands strong. No. You only think that because your parent's didn't give a shit about raising you.  Everything has a life span. Including idiotic memes that aren't even funny, like the Breelominati meme. Hell, just about everyone who enforces the Illuminati Confirmed meme has no clue about the actual Illuminati and the horrible crimes they did. And don't even get me started on the Ebola jokes. Then why do you act like a screwed up 2 year old who's been dropped on the head? But they're mindless and not even funny. Well, at least to people who have a brain, that is. I don't suck at life. Anyone who trolls a lot does. Get that smile off your fucking face; this is no laughing matter.  K99. I'm shocked how you're older than me. Based of you're actions, if I didn't know you're actual age, I'd think that you're a 5 year old. Trolling means that they don't give a shit on how others feel. Dumbass. No. They have all right to tell you that: you invaded their territory for no good reason. Oh, so you realize that they hate it? Then why do you continue doing this? Finally... Someone on my side... *To cuber bully for no reason. Ehh. You were neutral. You just admitted that you know trolling annoys people and that it's fun. And you still call yourself a good person? I don't think so. They're trying to make it stop. The next stop involves the cops. Remember that next time you hear sirens... No. Trolling=Cyber Bullying. You are annoying someone via online who you don't know in real life. That is cyber bullying.  A good person never annoys anyone ever. Yes, because you're not leaving them a lone with stuff that is obviously annoying them. It's called trying to communicate with friends but are being annoyed as hell.\n\nShocking. But you're constantly going at them instead of staying in one place. Not exactly. That's not cyber bullying. Get your facts strait. Cyber bullying still lasts on the website. It doesn't automatically go away. I'm just trying to defend my friends. I've been telling my definition of cyber bullying all day. They keep going at them. If you don't like her OC, don't go on her profile. That easy. You don't know a thing about the internet. They're not spamming, It's basically setting up base. That community is dead as fuck. You guys try and take over communities that are commonly used, thus, annoying people. How am I bullying?  Google it. It's better than Turtle's. That's for sure. The internet is always there. It can still be viewed by other people. Spam isn't even close to explaining it. It's pollution. Which means you don't care about how others feel. If you did, you wouldn't do it. Ehh. I'm in a rush responding to everyone, of course there is going to be the occasional brain fart.  Yet you just said that it goes away. I'm defending my friends, dumbass.  Hell, you call me dumbass more than anyone else. Explain that. And trolls are hated by everyone. That doesn't mean you should just point that out. No, it isn't. Next time they log back on, it's still there. I wouldn't be 'bullying' if no one decided to go annoy my friends. That's why the police are a thing. Yes, because everyone can just quit stuff like FaceBook, It's easier to quit smoking. No, you shouldn't. It's basically like if you gained a large pimple on your forehead, and everyone kept pointing at it and laughing at you. Thus making you a laughingstalk. You don't have to, but people just want to. You could always stop being that class bully who get's on every *normal* person's nerves. Say what you want, but your words are false. As in people who obey the rules. That was just an example. You point people out on their smarts. One rule is not to annoy people. I don't see that happening. Aiy. They call me me a dumbass...heh...you'll see, some day... Original/Own Character. Where did you find out? Cuz almost everyone here decided to be an ass and invade their territory. Where do you get Leftovers in OR? Well then... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wqKT5R2PXlw To make up for the fact that it isn't OU. I hope Game Theory does some episode on Lemmings. What was it then? Orbed? 1: You say you want this to be PG, but then I see the Theme of the Day.\n2: I need someone to battle in ORAS... I need to test some stuff out... It's what appears to be a female tango dancer, and if you have seen tango, it has some *special* poses. From my screen, it's a female in a red dress. It's probably one of those things that appear differently depending on what your using. Look at it through an iPad 3 screen, then tell me it's male. What are you using to go on Reddit? iPhone? Galaxy? What kind? Oh. Do you own any products made by Apple? :/ ...If you get the chance, hit the power button if it's off, then look at it. It's female from that screen. Then don't call me a dumbass **about that**.\n\n\n\nGtg. Back.\n\nAnd I just realized that there are more Physical tanks than Special tanks. Besides Bronzong, are there any other Pok\u00e9mon that can be either? (Not simotainiously, of course.) :(  Gimmie a sec. Wait, what's your FC? Mine is 4382-2105-7113 Bulky Dragalage? Huh. Oh, right, I forgot about Chansey/Blissey ans Shuckle. I never ran into a defensive Snorlax, tho. Aiiiiiy. Bronzong&gt;Metagross\n\nBut just so Junito doesn't rage...\n\nBronzong&lt;Mega Metagross\n\n\nBut this is just my opinion. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=43Py7eVS9L0 I wish I had SMS... I really hate that it isn't on the Wii eShop... Btw, mind if I battle you on ORAS later? Ok, I'll probably be ready in an hour or two. You game? -_- When my ful team is ready, you'll see that I'm not as weak of a battler than you all think... I just need to breed Sigilyph first... Go on, attempt for the spot. I would actually like to battle you for the spot. (I'll do it on seperate comments to make it easier.) 1: Mega Gallade \n\n@Galladite\n\nIVs: All but Sp. Attack\n\nEVs: Max Attack and Speed, 4 Sp. Defense\n\nAdamant\n\nClose Combat (might replace with Drain Punch), Knock Off, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch Bronzong @Leftovers\n\nIVs: All but Sp. Atack\n\nEVs: Max Sp. Defense and HP, 4 Defense\n\nCareful\n\nToxic, Stealth Rock, Heavy Slam (might replace with Gyro Ball), and Earthquake (most likely replace with Confuse Ray) Don't worry, I have things planned for it... Espeon @Choice Specs\n\nIVs: All but Attack.\n\nEVs: Max Speed and Sp. Attack, 4 Sp. Defense\n\nTimid\n\nPsychic, Shadow Ball, Dazzling Gleam, Grass Knot That would be a no, sadly. Man, I wish Bronzong got Rapid Spin...wait...doesn't it get Rapid Spin? And replace what? Malamar @Choice Band (It needs all the health it can get, it has no recovery moves or the best defense. That's why no Life Orb.)\n\nIVs: All but Sp. Attack\n\nEVs: Max Attack and HP, 4 Defense\n\nAdamant\n\nSuperpower, Knock Off, Psycho Cut (I wish it got Zen Headbutt), Rock Slide You'll only find out in our battle. And no, not Leaf Blade. Even if it was, Mega Slowbro's Defense can take it. (Don't have it yet, but I'm still breeding for it) Sigilyph @Life Orb\n\nMagic Guard\n\nIVs: All except Attack\n\nEVs: Max Sp. Attack and Speed, 4 Sp. Defense\n\nTimid\n\nCalm Mind, Stored Power, Heat Wave, Air Slash Nah, Bronzong needs recovory more than Malamar. You mean now or for the actual battle? Bronzong's Sp. Defense&gt;Claydol's Sp. Defense Either way, I only have one Leftover. I dunno. Showdown is usually kinda glitchy for me. Ehh, I've tried my set before on Showdown. It rekts. (Whoops, I meant Roost instead of Air Slash.) Stealth Rocks. :/ Ifkr. Ehh. Plus I already have the Bronzong ready. And it rekts more than you think. Can't. One of the glitchy things is that it won't let me view the rooms, so we can't find each other. It just stays on the loading screen for hours to pass.\n\n\nWhat members of you're team do you have? I have about 2/3s ready. I have Stealth Rocks because I really need some sort of entry hazard. I have Toxic to lay a status on it. I need Confuse Ray for a 50/50 chance of my opponent being able to attack until it wears off. And Heavy Slam/Gyro Ball is so I don't get walled by Taunters. Dafuq? How far are you in the game? ...Oh. *Sighs* Fine. Brb. I gotta make my team again for the 10th time. ._. Ok, ready. What's your Showdown name? Ok, but it's not showing me any users. VX9. Ok. [Me and Turtle's battle.](http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/anythinggoes-203740737) I wanna mess with my opponent's heads. Ehh. If there's a Sableye, I'll make sure Sigilyph has Dazzling Gleam. If not, Heat Wave should do something. *Too* unpredictable. Mostly for me. Why don't you want to be an Elite anymore? ...Either way. Why? You said you wanted to try for Psychic. No. It's just that a good portion of my team has nothing against Sableye and Spiritomb. Plus I forgot about Espeon, so I take that quote back. I dunno. I just heard from someone that you wanted to be Psychic at one point. :/ :| What in the world do you have against me? I'm not. And I forgot that my Espeon had Dazzling Gleam when I said that. Oh. They don't call me the Psychotic Psychic for nothing. Plus, depending on if it KOed Bronzor that turn, O'll either do Espeon on Gardevoir. Gtg. Back. So... How do I get the spot? And no one complains about this not being PG. ._. Does the Showdown Battle with Turtle count? http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/anythinggoes-203740737 He still battled like he meant it. It didn't seem like he was planning on making this a quick battle. Can I be tested on Showdown for the spot? And full permission. XD What did it say? And who said it? I didn't see. How come?  Well that sucks. How come? You know how laggy the 3DS version of Super Smash Bros. is online? Well, that laggy. Time to clear browser history.

Go Ravens! How do \"REARS\" taste again? The Bills are almost in the rear of the AFC East every year so I guess you guys would know huh? :)  Browner in his head lmao No gif but Torrey hit him twice and got called for the jab in the face the second time he threw it. Browner didn't even do anything back so it was kinda funny. He has Torrey's jimmies rustled already.  Not as much as angry Brees though. That shit is hilarious.  Not if you are the Seahawks. I love Bill :) Or a Ravens WR where you run 50 yards. Wait for the ball to get thrown and look for contact with the nearest DB. Rinse. Repeat.  Darrell Bevell would of called that earlier in the season. We ran like 5 per game lol Yep. Yep there is the normal Ravens 1st down maker.  Smith was also holding on to Revis...... He does it all game. Keep watching him and watch the replays. He is putting hands to the face often for no calls.  Joe is one of the better above average QBs. I won't ever put him in the elite category since he is inconsistent in the regular season. Something about the playoffs though make him amazing. He just has that \"it\" factor in big games.  Lenny is a guitar god? LMAO that is laughable.  There are so many better guitarists they could get. Slash, Eric Clapton ect. I just think they went with Lenny cause they really wanted to sing *American Woman* at the Super Bowl.  WOW that was so clear too.  LMAO lets be honest. We were all looking for the flag on that long bomb for the Ravens. Wouldn't surprise me at this point.  He intentionally threw that fucking short to get a PI......holy shit.  The catch was just a bonus. That looked like an intentional attempt at a PI. You mean to tell me that Flacco who has one of the best arms in the NFL throws a random floater that is super short to Smith? Not unless he is intentionally throwing the floater to help Smith cut back and make contact for a PI! Torrey Smith has the most PI calls for him this season and a lot of them look just like that play. Coincidence?  3rd and long. Here comes the floater for a PI.  Flacco throwing into double coverage and he finally paid for it.  Bailed out again lmao John is the Ravens head coach. I think you mean Jim.  You noticed that too? That commercial is from earlier in the year when the Seahawks still had him.  Nope. That is going to be overturned. Sorry Ravens.  From the front angle both his knees were also down. That is going to be easily overturned.  Why are the Ravens backing off so much when the Pats are basically dink and dunking all down the field?  I don't think the Pats have a DLine this game. They have been MIA.  Wow this 4th down is going to be their game decider. Make it and continue or miss and enjoy the off season.  Holy shit and the roller coaster continues.  Seriously the Patriots have ZERO pass rush. How have they won all those games this year with a DLine like this? Holy shit that was awesome. Anytime I see Flacco throw long to Torrey Smith I suspect he is going for a PI.  You're offense is what doesn't scare them much to be honest. Your defense will limit the Packers some but they can still outscore your offense in most situations.  Make em pay for going over the middle.  I know I should be rooting for the Cowboys to give us the match up against the Panthers next week but I can't. Go Lions!  Tate was right in asking who Barry Church was before this game lmao If you want to see an awesome game by him watch the week 17 match against the Rams last year while he was on the Seahawks. The entire game the Rams were gunning for him and hitting him on every single play. Guy just got up and smiled constantly the entire game. They were trying to get revenge for him taunting them in the previous match a few weeks prior. Guy is just straight tough.  3 and out for the Cowboys.  I love the holding on the offensive line that wasn't called. Could clearly see the Lion's jersey being grabbed and tugged while getting around his guy... Yes you can split an atom. It is called nuclear fusion bro.  Tate with his dancing and losing some yards. Always hated when he did that on the Seahawks.  Stafford just trucked a motherfucker lmao They are good but you have to beat the best to be the best. I just want the Cowboys to lose already to see all the belly aching going on.  Tate with the beast of a block. Still miss his fucking blocking.  This drive started on the 5 inch line too lol Blame us? They are all over the media even in losing seasons and have 5 championships. Plus hearing \"Americas Team\" makes me want to puke.  You are in a way. If the Lions win you get the Panthers next week which is a bonus lol Lions DLine has the Cowboys shook. Look at those runs and fast throws lol Hands to the face should of been called on that Cowboy. The Lion was pushed into the kicker so it isn't a penalty either.  It is different cause the Lions player was PUSHED into the punter by your lineman. If a player is pushed into the kicker it isn't a flag at all. The Cowboy player guarding that Lions player was also pushing his head back with a hands to the face which wasn't called.  Just read the guys autobiography. It will be better than the movie anyways. He talks about a lot of kills in it and at one point was watching insurgents using soccer balls as floaties to swim across a river to our encampments and was shooting the balls and watching them sink and drown. His book makes it seem more like shooting fish in a barrel than anything else since the insurgents were pretty fucking dumb. I can see why he got so many confirmed kills.  He has been. On that last play even two different Lions were getting held like crazy and it wasn't called. One Dallas lineman was totally turned around grabbing the back of a jersey.....pretty blatant and not called.  You did. It was played yesterday in the Panthers/Cardinals game as well.  That is why they made guns my friend. It is the great equalizer.  Him and Pacman getting into it over a TD score. I think Geno called them out even though the secondary was getting let down all day by the Bengals DLine getting zero pressure. It boiled over into a shouting match.  Umm don't you know? The Lions are doing nothing to keep the Cowboys from scoring it is all the Cowboys just playing bad that is stopping them from winning and ONLY that reason. /s  That was fucking huge by the defense. Seriously stood tall after the offense let them down.  I can do nothing but laugh right now.  That is what happens when you hear all week how the Cowboys are going to run all over you and easily win.  Cowboys get the TD anyways and the Lions come away missing a timeout....damn that worked out perfectly for the Cowboys.  That was the dumbest throw ever. He was covered by the entire back of the Cowboy so why even throw it?  #23 on the Lions was a pussy right there. Could of drilled Murray but went away from contact and Murray got extra yards..... Broken tackles are turning the tides right now. Dez getting a huge gain off a broke tackle and the Lions are trying hard to arm tackle on every tackle and seem afraid of contact all of a sudden.  LMAO that was hilarious. Since he was still coming down from the catch it is considered a defenseless receiver and he can't be hit in the head/neck area AT ALL. Doesn't matter if it is a helmet or shoulder.  Are the Lions in full choke mode right now?  Yes he did. He was pushing on his shoulders during the catch and also right after he ran buy him he also grabbed and tugged his jersey. Easily a PI or holding on the Cowboys.  If the Cowboys win this is 100% tainted. I will be rooting for the Packers next week all the way if it happens.  That Lions lineman was getting his neck broke by that hands to the face and no flag.  2 plays prior on the defensive holding the Cowboys tackle was facemasking the Lions guy that was about to tackle Romo. Had his entire hand grabbing the mask and the Lions guy head bent back and twisting and wasn't called either. The fix is in this game.  GO PACKERS!  Incidental contact with the feet is now a PI? One ticky-tacky call? Try a lot of calls all this year helping out the Boys.  Got'em coach!! Not even if it is food stolen from Cowboys fans? I think you can put your differences aside for a common enemy, right?  You really think the Cowboys are a hope for the NFL? The Cowboys were the first \"Seahawks\" in the 90ties and flooded their fan base everywhere. If the Cowboys go to the Super Bowl it will suck for 31 other teams in the NFL.  Cowboys just got 7 off a turnover..... It is hosted by Terry Cruz so I will watch at least one episode.  This Packers defense is looking like the one the Seahawks faced in week 1. Can't tackle for shit and kept letting our guys break free and get extra yards.  HAHAHA Dish is dropping the Fox News Channel. Is that really a bad thing?  Packers now is your chance to tie this fucker up right before half. Get it done! Well the second attempt was tipped at the line. Making it a 50 yard attempt would make the trajectory of the ball lower which makes it easier to block. The Packers played that perfectly.  All that time and still can't find a single target? If his calf was not injured I think he runs up the middle right there to gain some yards.  Probably wouldn't of had time to. They took a timeout and it gave the booth time to decide if they wanted to review it and they did.  Could say the same thing about the Packers turnover. Premature snap and then the fumble by Rodgers all on one play that led to a Cowboys TD. Which is why the NFL loves him. Better get used to him being the poster child of the league for a while.  **FEASTMODE** Damn I got a patriotic boner right now. I love football. I think he sings the anthem at least once a year in the NFL. Each time it is pretty damn good.  And the AFC North sent 3 teams to the playoffs in the AFC while facing the NFC South and AFC South this year (easiest schedules in the NFL which is why 3 of them are in). I don't see anyone complaining that the playoffs need to be based off strength of schedule....\n\nIt is perfect how it is right now PERIOD! Damn that was a craptastic kick.  Oh shit Peterson already getting picked on...... Cardinals need to get a turnover in a hurry to hush the crowd up. That crowd sounds pretty damn pumped.  I think ESPN is streaming it free on their website if you have a PC near you.  Williams will have to keep running like that to take the pressure off of Ryan.  No that would be the Bills fault. If the Bills didn't upset Greenbay they would of got homefield with the Cowboys as the #2 seed. Buffalo became my second favorite city in a single week :) That was a nice arm tackle by Peterson there. Fully extended and tripped him.  Cromartie looking good today.  Pete Carroll is 63. Wouldn't believe it though .  Well with the Cards offense playing like they are this is basically already a blowout lol Now that was a nice throw and a even nicer catch. Lindley showed some balls standing in that pocket.  Easy passes to build up confidence and it negates blitzes which the Panthers are sending a lot of.  Lindley keeps stepping farther and farther backwards in those pockets.  Holy shit Fitz!! Blame him? Seahawks did the same against him. Just load the box for the run and play man coverage all day and dare him to throw it.  And we have a ball game girls and gents.  All but 2 of those have been easy throws..... WTF happened to the Cards run defense in the last month?  Actually they have covered ok when not being blitzed. So far the Panthers are throwing a lot of blitzes cause they don't respect Lindley as a passer.  Cardinals almost got a hand on that pass.  See if the Cards can force a punt here. They really need too.  GODDAMN another fucking flag. Welp here comes a all out blitz that will probably result in a safety. Or the Cards will try to get smart and throw another screen that will also result in a safety.  Oh shit here come the No More commercials...... Everyone was expecting Lindley to pull a Lions there and run out of the back of the endzone. Everyone was thinking it lol Wow......... If there was a least valuable player it would go to that Punter. Cardinals defense starting to get in a rhythm which can be scary.  That was not Dockett was it? Well......shit That is a Touchdown actually. Wow that is a TD!!! Now that the game is not going Cam's way we will see how he responds.  If the Lions end up losing it won't matter. Seattle knows how tough the Cards play and will be ready for them. Bonus of being a divisional opponent. The Panthers on the other hand are kinda scary since they play us close in EVERY game for 3 straight years.  His hand was there but it in no way affected the catch and he took his hand off right away. It wasn't PI and the Panthers got lucky.  No he didn't. He put his arm around the waist and barely brushed him then immediately removed his arm. It in no way affected the catch or the route of the receiver. It would normally not of been called PI and would fall under the let them play since it didn't affect the play at all. It was a bad call and only people who love seeing flags every two seconds would actually call that a flag.  LMAO the first fake was actually the best one to throw too. He was one on one over there and would of at least got a couple yards and maybe more with a broken tackle.  Their offense has 70 FUCKING YARDS! That defense is tired as fuck and literally gets NOTHING from their offense.  Quest for 100 yards is still on for Arizona.  Yeah I am excited to see the Ravens advance tonight. :) Even the Punter sheds a arm tackle. Holy shit AZ can you please tackle..... Welp. Lindley still looked better in the hurry up than he did the entire damn  game.  Well even with the pick he did more in those two plays than he did the last 2 quarters put together. They had 6 total yards in the second half leading up to those throws lol Did the Cardinals offense even get past the 50 yard line this entire game without their defense/special teams putting them there to begin with?  77 total fucking yards for AZ.......holy fuck.", "topic_full": "game going shit fucking lol damn football cowboys play win", "label": "SeattleResident", "topic_id": "topic_6", "topic_distr": [8.2939053995473647e-05, 8.2939984900332406e-05, 0.19678382356561491, 8.2938324632577884e-05, 8.2937342486997457e-05, 8.2937423426213439e-05, 0.74867442954073149, 0.053961182793569012, 8.293712957343924e-05, 8.2934841069634988e-05], "mean_infl": 0.0004207073294861226}], ["spynul", {"topic_repr": "fuck man right", "text": " Best way to defend ones self from assholes.

Yes, I know not all legends are OP, but I don't like using them, because you either have to take a crap ton of time trying to SR for a good one, or you have to use PS. Don't worry, Ditto is allowed! It's just a different way of saying no legends, so people don't complain that not all legends are OP. Yay! :D Also, I consider smogon shit, just because they don't want me using stuff like Blaziken. Like, I couldn't even use a Blaze Blaziken on showdown if I wanted. Dude. That's not how it's meant. He meant no pokemon that CAN'T be bred, not pokemon that WEREN'T bred, like PowerSaved pokemon, although, he doesn't much like people who do that, either, but they're allowed, afaik. If you actually read the comments on that post... So you don't own any pokemon other than legendaries? Okay then. Opinions don't have to be nice. It could be filled with hate. Smogon themselves might not care, but then there are (some) smogonites who hate you if you use an uber like Aegislash, Blaziken, etc. Lol, yup! And get challengers. But both are private right now, so that won't be happening. All it really is is a different way to say no legends. That's what Kev intended it as, because there have been people \"freaking out\" saying not all legends are op, but that's not the reason legends are banned, it's because most are \"hacked\" for perfect IVs, or they require a lot of time to get with the right IVs. He didn't ban Ditto... We said in the comments (which K99 didn't read, obviously) that Ditto is an exception. Ok Nope, don't have enough powers. How 'bout we just say No Legends are allowed in the DE, like old times, without having to specify why, then maybe, just maybe, the shitstorms will stop. I dunno, maybe because the rules are still a WIP? How many freakin' times do I have to say it!? DITTO ISN\"T BANNED!!!! Yay for quoting me! Also, having sets in a post that people can use isn't neccesarily copying, it's a post for people to share sets.\n THE RULE WAS CHANGED! JUST NOT IN THE POST. Because I haven't asked for more. I have all but one, I think. Every time I ask for more, I get them. Aren't you an anti-smogonite? Or did you change your mind? Actually he does. He lets me do anything I want with the subred. Only thing I can't change is the rules. But that's because it's hit post :P Otherwise, I could. I have edited the subred's rules. Quite a few people, actually. Can't check right now, because I have to go. Kewl. You left, so why should I make you a submitter? Pat, Brett, Itachi (Brett and Itachi just don't go there, but they're allowed), and Alpha and James have actually been decently active. Yeah, but you can't edit them to have full powers, iirc. Anyways, i gotta go for now, seeya. Never actually knew that. Also never bothered to ask for full permissions. No, because my brother just got a new game, and wants me to play with him. Because I was playing, and still am. Ohh, you've redecorated! https://31.media.tumblr.com/4c8fd66dd07c7ece0550e61286c3023f/tumblr_inline_ne9qleQeds1r28vjk.gif  \n^^^^^^JK Silvah! Can I has my 'mons later? (I have to go visit my Pak\u00e8 in the hospital in a few minutes) Because. You only wanted a look at what had happened. You got one. NO! DON'T MAKE IT ALL CAPITALS!!!!!!!!! Btw, seeing as I formatted to make an alt for a really good friend, I need everyone's FCs  again. Mine: 2810-0493-9117 Silvah! Can we trade now? My FC: 2810-0493-9117 What's an alarm? YAY! Also, what about Serperior? What's a phone that has an alarm? Both? (Male+Female) Added you ? Wait, I know. You tried to have two upvote buttons, but it just changed the Latios to Latias, right? I saw it was different before I reloaded. Just added you. Why the heck is that Breloominati still there? We need a new Set of the Week! Wasn't it there since last Sunday/Monday? Oh, ok. Hmm... I *wonder* who that was...? XD ( \u0361\u0298 \u035c- \u0361\u0298) -.- What? I DID ask for 2 yesterday :P Also, I made you 2 alts. Ok. I can still breed with it, it'll just take more time. Can you add my FC? I already got yours/gave mine to you. BrettxJamiexBowen kunfhrmd! Yes, I am a part of this group of friends, although it seems you hate me for some reason now... Oh, and I forgot to put Keith in there :P So it's BrettxJamiexBowenxKeith Going online now. Lol! Btw, do you want a 6IV Calm Anticipation Eevee? I don't need it. Excuses, excuses. At least I don't make excuses when I lose. Except I actually do have skill. But I've only battled (I think) 7 people here, including FFAs. The reason I don't battle much on pokemon is because I never have a team ready. I almost have what I want, then I change up my team, like I did yesterday :P Nope. I don't. Unless you're talking about your \"ubers\". Also, I just changed up my team, so far I only have a small idea of what I want. But maybe I'll put all non-legends \"ubers\" on it, just to bug you. Looking through imgur when... http://imgur.com/gallery/1DjsUO1 Blaziken/Aegislash aren't ubers, imo. Although, I do agree with MegaMawile. Not with MegaMence, as I've never had a problem with it. *Whispers* It's not shiny... The type of pokemon you use has nothing to do with your skill. Did you ever see the BV of Kev battling an uber user that actually had skill? Their team had synergy, and they did predictions, etc. Just because someone uses something that you consider OP, doesn't mean they don't have skill. I used to think that Metagross/Magneton/evos of those two had levitate, back when I was, like, 9. Just because they floated. I had trouble beating my brother in pokemon games back then... Silvah's teh liah!!!! It's not purple! D: Believe it or not, I do. End of discussion. More than 3 Toshiros :P There's a reason I said \"More than\". I'll just change it, anyways. More than 9001 Toshiros. (That's still pretty low...) Ok. I already have yours, btw. I went to the OL FC board. What do you want? You just responded to it, lol. Ok. So far I gave you a 5IV-SpAtt Adamant Swablu (never checked it's IVs after getting it via WT, didn't know until after I started breeding it, lol), 6IV Calm HA Eevee, and 5IV-whatever Riolu+Koffing. 2810-0493-9117 Thanks a lot! You RQ'er you! Lol, jk. *Whoever has Dark gets locked after the 1 week immunity* Lol, now that you say it, it does! Ah, ok. That's only 1 point less in either stat.  #BullShit* Google it. It's an actual thing. I was surprised that it was :P Also, click Parent to see what he was responding to. It makes more sense then. I know. But I was more saying that for others. I know it's a joke. I just don't like assholes making fun of my friends, 1083. LOL NOH! LUCINA IS MAH MAIN! MINE, I SAY! :P kek. He did it to me last time, so I'm returning the favour :P I hasn't downvoted anything here. D: It's not a lie. I haven't downvoted anything here. I may have un-upvoted, but that's not downvoting. I never said I was pro with her :P But I'm getting much better using her. I can't really give tips, never been good at teaching. Ubers. Tru I dunno if you guys care, but I'm having a shiny giveaway.  \nhttps://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiNwisMIg Tru. That's also the reason I said \"I dunno if you guys care\" :P You just now realized that? That we do, eh? We spell things the better way. Also, a lot of us are more honourable than quite a few americans I've seen. (Stupid Reddit! It keeps thinking I'm spelling wrong! I'm Canadian, you assholes!) Favourite is correct. Not according to all these stupid american made programs though... Lel, lemme fix that. I never said all. I said a lot (about 60-70%, imo). Also, we don't go to war for the purpose of war. We send our army to keep the peace, like we did in Afghanistan for 10 years, before recalling our troops. Same crap, different pile. We also have it in jugs... My family buys it in jugs right now. Because Americans programmed that autocorrect. It's right on my parent's phones. \"You may not own a log cabin.\" That one is a lie. I've seen log cabins, and been in them. \"A total of 158 Canadian Forces personnel have been killed in the war since 2002.\" Honour* And I measure it by how a person acts, what they do to help others, etc. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How the shit do you prevent that from happening!?!? There's a law about this? It's never been enforced. I've seen purple doors. No fine for them. Lol, how I wish this were true! That'd just be hilarious! We have containers for the bags to be put in vertically, then you cut the corner of the bag open and pour out of it. Vinny. You wins Jirachi. Yeah. In the province I live in, no matter where you are, you're always a 20 minute drive from the water. \"Is Metang eviolite?\" Them showdown users. :P Lol And Majikhrp. Nope. This was a different one, from someone else. The ones you gave me are for my 150+ follower giveaway. (I got 15 followers from this giveaway, and now I'm 10 from 150. I need more shinies... :/) Lel, the guy who made that post won shiny Metagross in my giveaway. Kek. https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYQHAAABAAABUaXA8Hrcvg Look up ^ You idea stealer! That's what I'm making for the DE... (You probably saw it on my post, too) True. I was joking, but I forgot to put the \":P\", so I guess it didn't seem like it. 86* Pat yeahed it.  \nEDIT: 87* I yeahed it. Probably. It's a competitive Metagross, too. Impish, 6IV, Stealth Rocks Lel, yup lockdufter Lel. What's the DLC name? Ok. Where'd you find this? ? I haven't said anything about this over there. That's *totally* not stealing my idea for the DE... Well, it technically isn't, you never saw/heard my idea. \"already low karma\" you have 2000+ karma... They can go farther, it's just that in your preferences, unless you change it, it makes all comments below -4/-5 disappear from you. I have a Contrary HP Fire Snivy, if you want it. I have 800... I know, that's why I said \"Well, it technically isn't, you never saw/heard my idea.\" I'm only following 88... And half of 'em are you guys/your alts. Lel, that's been a running joke in the clan/guild for ages. One time someone said that to me, then I had a not so scary, but weird nightmare. Yep, I'm *totally* dating someone from Louisiana. (I can't actually see thia, I'm on my 3ds, I'm just guessing) Thought so. And no, we aren't dating. Just because we're two people of opposite genders that are friends, doesn't mean we're dating Message from Kev:  \n&gt; The ban is total nonsense. The mail says \"we've has enough of tour stalking and downvoting\". What? You know, that is what I never liked about the \"DE\", their speed to jump into conclusions. I was always against fast accusations because eventually it's obvious that we WILL falsely accuse an innocent person, and few things are as bad as undeserved punishment. They couldn't be farther feom the truth.\nFirst, mass downvoting is something I've never done. It is simply not my style. Also, why would I even bother? \"OMGGG I got a downvote, I am massively hurt\". Really? Downvotes do absolutely nothing harmful, it's a very pityful way of negatively affecting someone.\nSecond, why would I attack anyone there? Except for Jamie I never expressed any negative emotions towards anyone. I have no reason to hate anyone, even him. I'll just have the ones I dislike away from me and it's all cool. Which is why I was happy with the creation of the OL, it was the ideal way for me of getting rid of the DE troublemakers without causing harm or useless fights. Everyone happy. I have no resent whatsoever towards that league. In fact, I heard that some there hated me and had no idea why. I didn't even notice myself.\nThird, I HAVE A LIFE. I'm playing Xenoblade almodt all day, and when I don't I'm learning my songs to record them with my best friend/ guitarist/ singer's macbook. We contacted a producer and are planning to send him material. AND when I'm doing none of those things, I talk to girls or play SSB4. People allowed in the DE subreddit will know that I barely did anything to help the upgrading process and I feel linda bad for that. If I barely use reddit and when I do I mostly keep track of progress and help coordinating it, why and when would I waste time hating and doing bad stuff to others?\nAnd I can see Turtle calling BS on all of this because I seem to care and therefore the OL and doing shit to it is my life. No. I hate injustice, that's all. I'm happy to have this raw and unpleasant side of the DE purging itself. It was you who were holding us back from reaching our true potential and I wanted you gone from a while. The good guys from the DE and new people will take it where it belongs soon enough, without making countless enemies in the process. He said this yesterday, I didn't have access to copy/pasta until now, I was on my 3ds, and I'm back on it now. He does try, but he's got so much going on irl, so he isn't able to come on as often. Also, he recently made an epic banner thing, so that would've taken time. Actually, he didn't force me to, he just posted it on one of our posts, asking for it to be relayed. Also, he did say you were gonna call BS on this, if you actually read it. I ain't the only one there and here. Pat, Silver, Brett (occasionally), Itachi (occasionally), Chibi, Alpha and James. I was stating the ones with access to both. Also, I forgot Kev. K99 unbunned him earlier. He's been on here before... Also,  he hasnt even mentioned tf2 in ages. You realize that's k99, right? You're also not in a band and trying for a good relationship. Schoolwork is easy enough, life is not. (According to Silver, so do I :P) But that means you're not searching for one, because you have one. Whereas Kev doesn't, so he's searching for one. And? Millions of people do. Also, when you find someone online, you have to arrange a meeting, and then you have to \"try\" them out for a while, to see if ya like 'em. 1. Kev doesn't manipulate me. I offered to do what I'm doing over there. And I'm not even an elite...  \n2. We didn't invite Toshiro, we just asked for CSS help, and seeing as (at the time) Pat wasn't inactive, and I didn't somewhat know CSS, we asked him. (Btw, he's not an approved submitter anymore, he hadn't been there for 2+ weeks, so I removed him. And, imo, as long as he doesn't cause trouble, he's fine. The minute he starts causing trouble: Ban!  \n3. Kev only doesn't want some of you because you make more trouble than others, but if you stop that, you should be fine. 1. I like the idea of this (although I must admit, you're the last person I'd expect to suggest it XD), but I think we could have it like it was originally intended to be, as brother leagues, but we could have them closer, and we could get more challengers, or at least, more action, because if someone challenges one, they'll probably challenge the other, if they're closely linked. I'm pretty sure I remember something being said about them being brother leagues, when K99 made the OL. Also, that's pretty much what I meant, have the two so close, so everyone here is in/talking in both, kinda like I am right now, constantly switching between places. Also, this way, people like Jamie who don't like the idea, can stay in the OL, or people like me that don't feel like joining the OL for a spot can still be where they want. One more thing (forgot to say it in my last comment), I'm not copying the OL's banner, just the size of it. It's completely different otherwise. I never said it looked better, I just meant the banner pixel amount is the same. But (I dunno if it was you that said this, but someone did), I agree on the part that we would actually have all elite spots filled, but I still kinda want 2 leagues, just because they have different rules (The no legends one, for example. I like that one, but it would probably be gone if they were to merge D:) The banners CSS. There's literally nothing to it... All I did (because K99 didn't know where to look), was look at the banner itself, find the dimensions (150px), then I left. That's all I did. Steal the CSS? I didn't do that. Honestly, all I did was scroll to the bottom of the page, find the banner picture, and look at it's dimensions. That's all I had needed to do. Same, I don't want to merge, but I want the leagues to be close, so everyone will be busier, because if someone challenges one, they'll most likely challenge another. Take your CSS plans? All our CSS was put there by us (and silver changed a few colours, because I couldn't figure it out). Breloominati* Me... Ah. Well I was *almost* an elite, several times. But then again, almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. That's exactly what we have been doing (except for the seeing it part, I think it'll seem like a better change if it's different right away) That's pretty much what I mean, just worded differently. And also have most people, if not all, on both subreddits, just so one isn't active while the other is [DE]d. Unless Pat or Silver have been taking OL CSS, but I believe I'm the only person to have changed it recently, so that's not happening. Working on it :P Soooo....... Target Canada is shutting down, meaning my mom is out of a job (one of her 2, but the other is more a hobby), meaning my family lost half it's income. :( Kev did a bunch of basic CSS, then though \"I have no clue how to do this shit\"* :P He really has no clue how to do anything but the basic stuff, but I learned in a few days time how to do it (not how to write it, but how to place it, etc.), so we have someone other than Pat/Silver who can do it :D This is literally all of the CSS to the banners of both subreds:  \n/* BANNER */  \n\n #header-bottom-left {  \nbackground: url(%%banner%%); ALL of Target Canada. Target America, no. It's called procrastination, and I have exams in 11 days D: Well, I *should* be able to get a job next summer, so I can help with the income that way. Hopefully. http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/target-closes-all-133-stores-in-canada-gets-creditor-protection-1.2901618 That person was saying how good they were, and how no one could beat them. So, naturally, I sent them to you :P Kek. That's the only person I've ever sent your way. Question, what account is your banned account? SilverForAG? D: How dare they!? Ah, ok. When it's unbanned, you're able to link it to your Wii U for actually getting it unbanned, right? Wii U can have several accounts... I just went on For Glory, and everyone I fought in 1v1 spammed everything. Villager spammed the rocket/slingshot combo, Bowser Jr Down B, Little Mac spam, everything spam. Only one person actually fought without spamming. That was me. You'd probably annihilate me, I'm barely beating Classic 6.0, and I have somewhat bad internet, although it's really only noticable when fighting Ty. I thought your Bowser Jr. wasn't as spammy as others. I'm still following him. Thoght I unfollowd ages ago, unless ti was following him on my alt, I ws tryig ro get all my followrs back, andnhe was following me. He was the leadr of an old clan I was in. Holy shit.

Hate it when that happens... Didn't see that, I like that too. I wonder if the ability will just change when the pokemon is moved over, or only when it's bred/caught in thw new games. Oh shit yes. Only when fighting you, with your McDonald's internet. When on For Glory, I have no problem whatsoever. Where did you even see that (shows how much of a smash noob I am)? Ah, ok. Maybe it was that day, or maybe it was just a combination of ours, because I was playing For Glory before and after that, and it didn't lag out. Good Sawsbuck sets, anyone? :/ Thanks. Physics?

DxD Go on a computer. I think he meant the demons part. The main character of this show is just... All he thinks about so far is boobs... True. You heard wrong. I only like this so far for the plot, it's interesting. Ok den. How far are you? I'm on 3rd episode, it actually gets interesting near the start of the second. Koso! That's why I like Lucina. I can only 1v1 because of my internet, and she's good for that. Kono Yarou! Nihongo de hanasu teishi! Romaji? And, at least use the english alphabet, like me. Ah. That's a very nice box. My niece. XD I don't have a phone :/ I don't get one until I'm 16, too :( It's bootyful. &gt; Bug: K99*  \n  \nThis is on the elite list on the DE subred. ~~Make you harder*~~ I mean, uhh, I didn't say anything... My cousin's bird died today :'( :O How old was it? My cousin got his 12 years ago, and, as far as they know, he was 4 years old at the time. Don* Aaron's still alive on MV lel. I haven't seen him in a few days, but he makes a post every so often. \"Ehhh..not really into chicks...\" Kek Ok, so it seems I started High School DxD on season 2, so luckily I only saw 2/3 episodes. Time to start season 1 :P Lel. I clicked a link from someone asking where to watch it, and it seemed as if it could've been season one, as in, it wasn't confusing. \"1:27:41\" Pfft! Ain't nobody got time fo dat! It's an hour and a half. His shitty Team Smash partner. Probably For Glory. Do I have you on my FL? BTW, I'm streaming something, so my internet may not be the best right now. Time for my shit internet to kick in :P I closed it, so my internet is fine now. No lag this match. I'm obviously the smash nub here. We'll have to fight sometime to see who is, then XD Loser* It was only a little bit of input lag when I fought Silver. I'm surprised my internet isn't being a dick right now. I guess my parents don't have a million things open today. I'll change it next match. I haven't played Ike in a while... Kuso! I hate it when that happens! Occasionally, when I'm off stage, I can't do anything except Up+B, which is not the preferred thing to do with my characters most times. Same shit, different pile. And I like japanese. Yakamashii ? Dayum. I got #Rekt by AAA. GG AAA! I'm still pretty sure I'm the worst smasher here :P 2810-0493-9117 Yup. Although, everyone here has beaten Classic 9.0 (I think). I've barely beaten 6.0... In a bit, gotta shower. And in reply to your other comment, there's a reason I said \"(I think)\" Not me. I actually found it not annoying at all, compared to other Bowser Jrs I've faced. Damn, I want to watch the next episode of HSDxD, because cliffhangers, but I have to go to bed... :/ Do you mean in the show? Only 4-6th episode, I accidentally watched S2 before, didn't realize it, because it made sense without S1. Lolnope. Psychic is vacant, and Kev has also said to me that he's never gonna be a DE elite. Besides, why would toshiro even try for that? He only has a steel mono, which is pretty crappy, or so I'm told. It was 9:30, my parents like to think that that's already late, and that I don't get enough sleep. I stay up until at least 12 every night anyways XD  \nI just can't have my laptop with me. You stop being a hypocrite. Smash, anyone? I made a room. Sure! I'm practicing a new character, btw. Damn! I was so close! Stupid smash ball... Thought I already had. Anyways, thanks for the battles, I gotta finish my HW though. :'( Sorry aboot that, my brother started streaming stuff, eh? GG Almost 900 karma :/ ~~Downvotes~~ I mean... what?  #GoodThingIDon'tDownvote Lel, I was literally just looking at a screenshot of someone playing as him on my 3DS.

I already have Metroid, LoZ, and don't want to get DK, although, I might, as I already have this for the Gameboy. But the cartridge is slowly breaking apart D: It still plays fine, though :) 2* I'm going to be using my alt again, I need it for something KoH is doing. KoH is gonna make a league, and no one wants to actaully get banned, like how it always was with the DE, so I'm hosting it on FrostOP. ? Either I worded something weirdly, or you worded that weirdly... I was actually planning on using it on my team. Although, I might just use Razor Claw Super Luck Night Slash Absol. Crits all the time. I've known how for ages :D I also haven't bothered to look through CSS of other subreddits. Too much CSS :/ 130 base attack is terrible? :/  \nYou need to stop banning the alts I get for you. Yup. Also, people need to stop being idiots. It's not banned. What's an uber? Nope. Nintendo didn't ban it, so it's not banned. What's a smogon? That's a weird name... I was literally just about to post that I was pulling a Turtle. XD :/ Nah. Just finished Ep 7 or 8, gotta go to bed now, so I can't watch more :'( An anime not for children, which is exactly why I'm watching it :P  \nJK, I'm just watching it for the plot, the other part of it isn't that appealing to me. Lol, yup. *Start of Season 2*  \n**BOOBS IN YO FACE!!!!** I just redownloaded Legend of Zelda (The original one). I shall start that quest now :D True. hespeaksthetruth.jpg How old are you?

It's probably a big deal for Kev's band, another song for them to play/publish. Nah, you don't have to do that, it's still good, even without rhyming. You seriously didn't know that? Huh. Idk. He's mentioned it quite a bit. Yup, you have, but not since the OL was made. :P  \nHe hasn't mentioned it over there though, since the OL was made. You were. Key word: were. You were water DE, and I was gonna challenge you, but never finished breeding my team. Hey Silver, what was the name of that teambuilder app? I stole my brother's old phone, so I can download it finally :D Sweet! This'll be really useful for when I'm not at home and forget my team I planned :) I also luv Ice Crem. Because you get notified when your username is mentioned, unless you turn that off. My friend's (now ex) girlfriend sent him nudes randomly. She also asked for sex, and when he denied, threatened to rape him. And more stuff, but since there was so much she said/did, him and his mom called the police on her. She was complete psycho... Isn't she 20ish? This crazy, psycho bish was 14. She also failed grade four. Lel. Night? It's 5am! O w8... You're on the opposite side of the country... Timezones tho. Nuh Turtle! Don't leave meh!

Let's go good football.\n\n\nNot sure who I want to win.\n\nProb the Ravens for Smitty! Yeah that will be sadly the Colts/Broncos tomorrow, most likely. Not the ravens for smitty? Not to be mean...but in this case your name suits you.   Flair for me? Ha!  Who needs ray rice?! Nice catch! Damn.  What happened to your D, pats?  (seriously it was pretty good) Lucky.  Started to look like us, NE! Didn't that hit the ground?\n\n\nI dunno.  That's pretty close.  Looks like it's moving I like this music If it's moving and hits the ground it shouldn't be a catch. I like the music in it OH!  SNAP!\n\n\nNo catch!  4th down! Reddit already breaking on me :( A catch reverse.\n\n\nOh and pats d being asleep...ravens marching down the field and scoring, easily. Most people saw it happening.  It's honestly sad.  He's so good, IMO.  A legend. Smitty fired up!\n\nOh yeah! AP shot him Nice catch, smitty!\n\n\nTD! Gronk is such a goofy bastard Wide open!\n\n\nThat should not happen! Nice throw!  And catch Hope so. Well over his head and behind him.  Bad pass. Brady does it himself!\n\n\nTD! Nice blocking...nice run NO!  Not smitty! I heard it was bad...but I think it looks good. That's par for course tho.  They usually call the last one. A stop.  Pats D stepping up Yeah but it's usually the last one who gets called.  Happens all the time.  Should be on both, I think. Sack! Love.  Pure love Another sack! Brady getting pissy 'cause he got kicked in the face Tisk, tisk...pats.\n\n\nThat's gonna be costly. Fumble! Oho!  Lucky again! Brady hit hard Good job getting that off!  Very close to a sack. Not playing the ball.\n\nPI or holding at least Drop by Gronk I would pay to see that.  It would be hilarious. Nice catch!\n\n\nTD! They are actually getting to him for the most part...he just gets it out so fast. I need to see this replay Ah ok.  That's fine then. He was forcing him out.  Can't do that TD!  Nice catch and Flacco just threading it in there. No.  He forced him out of bounds.  The DB needs to let the WR run his route...cannot impede it and force him out like that.\n\n\nThus the call. Nude Snoop confirmed! Lenny Kravitz is good...but he's nowhere near a guitar rock god. Me either.  She's a damn hypocrite and a terrible singer. That should have been a flag lol Nice stop Going for it? Gutsy call!\n\n\nNice catch! Nice run.\n\n\nDidn't even touch him. The premise of that movie is so fucking stupid We all do.  Stupid ass movie. Not a good idea to count brady and bb out until the very end, IMO. Kind of ironic considering that 10% of your brain bullshit. Lions fans were doing that as well.  Same with a Bengals fan last week.\n\n\nSad, imo. What's the bench doing? Ah came on the field.  \n\n\ntisk, tisk. lol.  Al said 'well Jon is no Dez Bryant'.  And Chris is like 'and dez bryant didn't get called'.\n\n\nOh burn! It was hilarious!  Both of them!\n\n\nI love it Daniels hurt Who's this odell person other than OBJ? I like it also :) Oh shit!\n\n\nNice throw and catch!\n\n\nSurprise TD! No.  Buck is terrible. Nice pick! Are these tips or just bad throws? Easy first down But if you weren't a pussy and hit that fat kid in the nose he'd run to his momma crying.\n\n\nYou can hit Suh in the nose and he'll pick you up and slam your ass down.\n\n\nThere is the difference. I'm rooting for you Dallas as my kid likes you (poor thing is from Texas). These pregame people are mostly all idiots.\n\n\nTerry is entertaining but he has like a 50 IQ, clearly. Like everyone said in the last 3 games.  *rollseyes* Who would you rather us play?  Seattle (if Dallas wins) or Greenbay (if Detroit wins)? Yeah me too.  Buck sucks and so does Phil Simms.   Custer died, yo.  Why bring that up? Not really I want revenge against the Seahawks-and yes I believe it will be a good epic game with our D vs their D and we shall prevail.  So I'm rooting for Dallas (also my kid likes the Cowboys). He looks like he has Meth sores I'm not sure what gold does...but I'll play.\n\n28-17 Cowboys. We don't get any respect as normal.  It's cool. I think Mike Periaria (sp?) is an idiot and I don't like hearing him talk. Hell yeah-I think it's Mike tho. Nice catch by him.  Almost fumble is not a good start. Romo throwing high like all the other QB's this postseason so far. Nice hit Bell has a great story.  I liked hearing about it.  I hope he does well in the league. C'mon Church...where is your revenge.\n\n\nTD Tate Yes hilarious :/ Buck is an emotionless monotone Robot.  Aikman is ok...but he's a big homer and mostly pretty dry. Close one.  Almost had that.  nice knockdown. Romo is going to be in some serious pain after this game. Beasley has hair like Bursin.  Is he terrible, too? Lucky punt....ah too bad about flag tho As long as Romo is not broken in pieces by that point...and as long as Murray is not hurt. Uh...holding much? Running into...not roughing. Really with bush?  Isn't he done yet? Nice run.\n\n\nHe's a big boy as well.  Him and Luck and Ben.  All so big. No that kid is a real rb.  Bush is done...give it more to bell. Looks like a big fatass to me.   Yeah so annoying now. Sound like that Bengals fan from the other topic. Nice work, Bell I haven't had the PH one, but the lil ceasers is good.  It has nacho cheese instead of red sauce on it.  It's pretty good, IMO Bush looking much younger now Ugh.  she's awful.  I don't care if she's 3 Damnit reddit.  POS servers dying Finally a stop Read only mode.  Fucking redddit. Taking cues from Bursin My reddit is broke.  It's like 2 minutes behind the comments lol I read somewhere that people try to poke you in the anus under there so you drop the ball. So is UFC like owned by fox?   You are killing me reddit.  Fucking hell Nice!\n\nTD! Lions Should be a first, IMO I hate the song...but like the lil animated thingies in it Oho nice pick! Ziggy with the sack Love that guy's name, btw Cursed him, buck. No they always favor the cowboys.  No one in here is saying the announcers are favoring the lions.   PI? Nah...I guess it's ok This movie looks weird.\n\n\nAnd channing tatum with eyeliner is rather creepy. with eyeliner.  So strange Nice work! TD! ugh...holding It was holding on the o Dangerous pitch in traffic Stopped?  Yep TD!\n\nnice work Whitehat and Greyhat you mean. First 2 were decent, mindless mostly, action movies.  3rd looks to be about the same. Just more bread. Dallas' bursin looking much better than Carolina's bursin. Hockey pucks My kid likes y'all so I'm rooting for ya. hard hit.  Ouchie Almost got away Sacked again.\n\n6 fucking sacks 3 point game 6 His a big fatass like ben...hard to bring down. PI.  You have to turn for the ball, mang. Wait...wut? True.  but it was pi Terrible punt.  Taking cues from ariz punter. Fuck your ow screen reddit.  It's very annoying. He was practically hugging him and he didn't play the ball like he's supposed to.  \n\n\nTotally PI Nice work Witten!\n\n\nBalsey play works! Should have tho He's always been Romo's security blanket.   Holding...again.\n\n\nEvery time they get a 3rd down this seems to be the case. Nice TD Go down dumbass\n\n\nUgh.  If you get a fumble...go the fuck down Ah cool.  This fucking broken server shit is messing everything up Yeah if they can't fix their shit I'm gonna be done with this for game threads Making RW miss football.  You should be ashamed fox He does tho.  His eyes are blodshot and barely open.\n\n\nI'm betting he's hung over and not stoned.  They prob partied hard last night. Those are actually sad-damn near make me choke up every time I see those poor lil animals :,(  \n\n\nThese ones are just awkward.   That's rude.  What is this 'we irrelevant' thing?  Freudian slip? Lacy is just so much better than TRich.  Funny he was his backup for a year. For Lacy?  Yeah.  He did well. I'm not sure either of these teams can beat seattle, tbh. I agree 100% I don't think it actually was tipped This is NOT icebowl 2.  Let it go already, stupid Buck and Aikman. Fumble!\n\nGB has it I think! Yeah I guess so :/ Yeah.  I really liked Peppers :( So ready for this! 4:35 east coast time, I guess. Wow.  Haven't seen Brian McKnight in forever Same here! Actually, really, scheduled to start at 4:35 eastern.  It just started...so I'd say not very Nice stop.  Shoulda had him tho Ugh-close turnover.  Be careful guys Nice.  No drop! It's working fine for me Oh yeah another! Close almost int. It's good! Both teams combined?  Over Yeah he's a good singer.  Unlike these voice/american idol people they always bring out. That kickoff was almost a fg lol Fucking stopped! I like the card's punter lol Yeah odd play, but it went ok. PI! Chud use to run some cool ass plays before he went to the browns and then got fired. Well holding at least Nice...Love Philly! Olsen! Fucking TD!  JSTEW! Nice pass...ouch Then?  No.  Now...yes Well...at least y'all got 1 first down. Fuck me BS! He always is.  Love that guy.  So damn good Our D is straight up hyped! C'mon Norman.  Be a hero! Wow.  Fitz beasting What an odd commercial.  I like it...minus the singing. We won our division.  Division winners get homefield.  Get over it Yeah I was like ok, ok, ok...uh no way. Daaaaammmmmnnnn! It was kinda cool....with vg stuff.  And then a gb fan sharing a fry with a chi fan.  I was like nope. Ah sorry.  A lot of people are salty about it lol. Aww.  Too high.  So open ty ari...auto 1st down Nice run.  Almost broke through, too. Hell yeah! Find a stream! Don't get hurt, Cam! lies! I think he should have had that.  Went right through his hands there. Nice catch Yep...was hurt.  I think he's back tho. Damn it He usually catches hard ones and drops pretty easy ones.  It's weird.  He's not bad at all...just could be much better if he dropped a lot less. That movie.  I don't buy it. Pretty cool Saaack! Stay away, blondie That's a good catch Nice! Oh so close Wobbly throw, but he should have had that ty ariz punter, again :) fuck Fumble! Hells yeah! same.  my heart right now! Damn, but that is a good call.  It was a td, it looked like. I'm sorry but this dr pepper guy is creepy as hell.  I don't like him. Nice run.  Jstew putting in good work today Yeah it seemed totally on the WR Ow.  He got kicked in the face while down. Nice run, Ginn Clear holding Why recap a game all of us have seen?  I never got that.  So stupid. He had like forever...and still got us the 1st down :) Nice run again Nice!  I'm very surprised he got that throw out.   Yes!  So needed that We can get rid of Williams ooooohhhhh!  Yeah! Our inside man ;) PI...so PI ty refs :) Hells yeah! Yes.  But 'biased refs' Yeah that was great.  Did you know the sale was real?  It was Lies Yep, it was. Big hit He ran into him...hey Sure...when ariz is getting like 45 total yards of offense...it's all on the refs.  \n\n\nWut It's been much better lately.  We have a bunch of people hurt...so a lot of our team is cobbled together. That was a good call. Flags...so many flags. Good explanation  He's up there in age...so his kids are most likely grown. Bah.  Nice try tho. Sack.  Niice. Luuuuukkkkkke! Bersin is really bad tho...what's up with the knees catching? He's been grimacing for awhile.  I wonder if his back is hurting him still or ribs? wut Forward pass.  Fuck that Fuck you Sounds like you are crying It's ok.  Lindley came through for us :) Niiice run Flag?\n\n\nTackle out of bounds much? Williams making runs?  \n\nWut Noob, eh?  stop fucking whining and drop it already, looser.\n\n\nLike it matters at this point lol Or deangelo williams...\n\n\nlol He says that pretty much everytime he calls our games lol. Beasting! That commercial is kind of amusing, IMO. Better than williams, IMO.   He got it? ahhhh!   my tv cutout!\n\n\nOh thankgodit'sback Well.  That worked out well for them Niiiice!\n\n\nThanks refs.  Those ints were all you \n\n/s Like a fella once said 'ain't that a kick in the head'\n\n\nFO:NV memories, man. What is ginn doing? Fewest yards ever in a playoff game.\n\n\nArizona came to play :/\n\n\nGG Yeah totally :/ Well.  GG cards.  You will be a good team if y'all had an actual QB.\n\n\nWhy he wasn't replaced is beyond me.\n\n\nSee you next week Sea or GB.

If a dude wants to get circumcised, he can decide on that as an adult. Former JC Penney pricing guy, here.\n\nIt's not just Black Friday. Literally every sale. [Completely accurate](http://www.gallup.com/poll/155285/atheists-muslims-bias-presidential-candidates.aspx). In Torchwood - British government is willing to sell schoolchildren to aliens to be used as intergalactic drug mules. Wouldn't happen here.\n\nFiction is not fact. If it doesn't matter that much, why take the extra effort to slice and dice babies' genitals? It is. You're trying to judge the people and government of a nation based off of a fucking TV drama because you know fuck-all about that nation's actual policies and people. Should I talk about Black Mirror showing a PM fucking a pig? Would that make you feel better? Guys, this guy was too passive-aggressive to criticize things directly, so he had to pretend like he has an audience instead of speaking to the person he's speaking to! That means he's mature.\n\nSo, then, I *should* talk about the problem of British politicians having sexual congress with pigs? Because it *sounds* like you're trying to excuse your country's TV dramas not accurately representing your country, but still wanting to take other countries' TV dramas as accurately representing their countries. &gt;that is a fact\n\nIt's an oversimplification, is what it is.\n\nOur healthcare system is fucked up, certainly. It needs work, certainly. But *you* obviously have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. That's moving the goalposts quite a ways from \"let the person who owns that penis decide whether to cut off a chunk of that penis,\" don't you think? Then I would suggest that maybe we shouldn't force it on children. Actually, no. I was there during that fiasco, and what he did was to do fake sales less effectively.\n\nFair and Square, on paper, meant that they just did the actual price. Fair and Square, in reality, had us jack the actual price up 5 to 20 dollars over the sale price (or, in some cases, over the *full* price. Men's khakis, for instance), then we had a very few \"monthly deals\" and \"seasonal deals\" that would put them back down to the previous sale price.\n\nWe also quit sending out coupons, which meant that the old ladies who came in during Doorbusters to get shit at the sale price came in with BOGO coupons and got twice as much shit. With things *around* the sale price all the time and no coupons, the customer objectively got less stuff for their dollar. And our customers were smart enough to work that out (because if there's one thing the grandmas coming in knew how to do, it was figure out coupons).\n\nOh, and they deliberately fucked up the color scheme. JC Penney had spent 5 years reinforcing a color scheme for tags: White was the full price, and then there was Red Zone clearance with red (or pink) stickers. What did former Target exec Ron Johnson do? White was the old full price (which was a lie), red was the new F&amp;S price (which was often, as I said, the old full price), and blue was clearance. You might not think this is a big deal, but it was. For the first three months, everybody who wanted clearance racks was completely fucking lost. Nevermind that clearance items across the board went from ~$5 to ~$15 or more. We had $75 blue stickers.\n\nBut *none* of that had anything to do with why the company nearly went under. *That* was because he decided to do a bunch of shit he couldn't afford, like remodel every store in the country to look like an Apple store (with iPads!). A year later, somebody told him that they couldn't afford that, and they flat-out just stopped remodeling stores halfway. My store, for example, was remodeled in the Young Mens and Misses sections, but the entire rest of the store was still in the mid-'80s aesthetic it had always had. They just fucking stopped.\n\nHe also decided to ignore JC Penney's customer base of old and fat women in favor of trying to get young, skinny women, which just pissed off the people coming to the stores, and didn't draw in the young, skinny women.\n\nAlso, they fired like, half of their workers. When I left, my job consisted of doing in 4 hours a job that when I had been hired, was assigned to 5 people over the course of a week.\n\nIt's amazing what a great PR campaign they've done for that program now that it's over, because they sure as fuck didn't have a good spin on it when it was actually happening. I implied nothing. I'm sure your parents loved you very much. I'd say tattooing babies would probably be considered a fucking awful thing to do, most of the time... Generally, yeah. Life is super-complicated. Most popular storylines are not. If it's not a big deal, why take all the extra effort of performing elective surgery on a baby? &gt;You can actually grow your foreskin back by stretching\n\nNo, you cannot. The result is not actually a foreskin. I'm glad you still felt the need to say something, though. http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2rb0pa/nonamericans_of_reddit_what_american_customs_seem/cne7kl8 They still had good appliances when I was there. Decent bedding, too. [This is why](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1j0ulc/my_buddy_stationed_overseas_just_posted_this_to/cb9z878). So, then, the fact that his entire time at the company was marked by 20-30% drops in sales, one of the biggest slumps in the entire history of the company was...what? Because the new customers were *also* stupid and out of date? ^(That was sort of my point) [And a Target guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Johnson_%28businessman%29). I never at all denied that. I simply mentioned one of his former jobs.\n\nOne with a retail tagging color scheme similar to the one he put forward, which is relevant to the paragraph where I mentioned his former job at that place while talking about retail tagging color schemes. *He's* deflecting by trying to make this about whether teenagers can get their ears pierced. I don't see how *I'm* deflecting when I maintain the stance that this sort of thing is morally repugnant to inflict on infants. &gt; Revamping and rebranding one of the oldest standing department stores in the US is going to take longer than 18 months.\n\nEspecially if you can't afford to finish remodeling the stores because you're managing the company so poorly.\n\n&gt;enjoytech\n\nThat press release reeks of Amway. Oh? Ear gauges and tattoos weren't two of his examples? He's not blatantly shifting the topic of discussion away from \"doing this to infants\" toward \"well, ok, but do they have to be *adult* adults\"?\n\nCould've fooled me, man. We suspected a lot of that was going on, but we lost our LP people in the layoffs, so we couldn't do anything about it. &gt; Your argument, from what I infer, is that those two things can't be compared\n\nExcept that I replied that tattooing babies (which would *be* the comparison to be made) is fucking awful. I worked *directly* within his comparison, and came to the same conclusion.\n\nThat's not deflecting. Hey, thanks for the info.

Well I mean he managed to lose to us, so he's not giving himself a good name AMAZING PASS Nah, that would be way too exciting Wow YES FUCKS YES EXCITEMENT IT'S TOMMY TIME JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN THIS GAME This game is fucking amazing Playoffs, baby. That D ain't nothin to fuck with So has everyone else Flacco lookin' fly as fuck Dem legs bruh Fuck it, just run on 3rd down every time Newton Well that's not very Riverboat of him Just remember that by tomorrow night, there are going to be 4 NFC teams left in contention for the Super Bowl. And one of these two teams has to be one of them. That tackling tho Welp  \n\nThat's it, then. Holy shit fuck these refs so hard Are the Cardinals really the team that needs to get fucked by the refs right now? You know, the team led by Ryan fucking Lindley? Least they can do after trying to keep them out of it I mean... Yeah. You can't just go and say he's worse than Weeden without 10 pages of evidence.

I have the same problem! It's a glitch. It isn't legit from the start. F-Zero baby... Get on the racetrack and show me your moves. Yay! I'm finally back to kick some tail!\n\nDK! Donkey Kong! The bug type move being used on Malamar is U-Turn.  That means you've lost about 55% of your total wins. I was just saying how your total loses stack against your total wins. Smashing! Malcom X? Who? Ah. That moment when 11 people pick the same stage and 1 guy picks random and the game picks random which then random picks the same stage as the other people. Show me your moves! ? ? But didn't you used to say that because you got bullied so much at one point in your life, you learned to ignore those kind of things? So why that even matter? Just play the game. Okay... Ah. But who cares? Let people be dicks. It just means life is harder on them. It's a trick called a B-Reverse. You have to move the direction of your contol stick in the opposite direction that you are moving and then your character will do a B-Reverse. It doesn't work for every special move. You have to do it in about 3-4 frames of the start of the move. That's a dumb reason not to play online. Because people are dicks? Well everyone online community people who are dicks. Hello. But how will you get better if you don't play against those who are better then you? I'm fine. And you? I did it a bunch with Mario and R.O.B. in SSBB. Oh well. That is good. Uh sure. M'kay. M'kay. M'kay. BTW, was your Garchomp Scarfed or Banded? Ah. Something like that I think would eat through my team if Skarm is gone... Maybe.  And the movie is overrated. Yeah. That's what happens. Well what can you do? They do what people do on the internet. Complain. Oh right. Forgot about that. What did he do in the first place? Oh. There. I made it. Yeah. I see my MegaGross! Alrighty then. 4 Arms! I know. 4 Arms and Legs! Because it is. Except not. That just one theory of a million. Of course! I love Majora's Mask! Anybody want to play some Smash Wii U? Alright then. But you don't have a Wii U? Do you have a Wii U? Alright. Gimme a few minutes. I'm gonna go eat and then I will tell you when I put up the room. Uh... Let me check my wallet. Nope sorry. Don't have enough. You should. Especially with the new games coming out this year. Okay. Then no Smash Wii U for you. The room for Smash Wii U will be up. I was about to watch that video! It seems to be a game about trying to avoid despair and suicide while you are a part of the world that wasn't infected with a dealy disease. Sounds heavy already. Welp... Mr. Smiley might not see his daughters again if he doesn't lower suicide rates... Looks like I'm heading into deeper shit... #NewMeta# Welp... People know how to write. And godamn some people really know how to write. That is due to the writing being good. All these things together can compliment each other very well if done well. Yes it does. And when it does... Well you already know the results. You think? Perhaps it might be glitching? I like how he says that when he's the guy complaining about people on their Wii U while he's on his Wii U. Hypocrite. But I play Lucina too. Slightly. Yup. Random Omega form. Well of course. You've only recently started gettin good. I've been practicing for years. I can try it out. What is it? I hate that. Behold the greatness that is Super Smash Brothers! People do crazy shit in Smash in every version. You mean Gigiyas? Just wait until you see the fetus form. I think it's on the Wii U's eShop. Well you could try and call Nintendo? Welp. Should have wrote that shit down. Yup. FU=Fuck U. Are you serious? You can't be serious... Talonflame was never uber... If you're just acting dumb... Then good job. Skullkid is unlocked through the Adventure mode. Majora's Mask bruh. That stuff sells like fire. Wait seriously?  Dammit. The amiibos sold $8 million in the first month in the US alone. So yeah. So more Marth amiibos are coming to the US since Codename S.T.E.A.M allows you to use the Fire Emblem amiibos in it. Monster Hunter? Maybe. I might try and beat the single player first. And I have other friends that we play as a group in. Young Link with Fierce Deity mask. I'm getting it. I kinda wanted the Mask itself to just fly around on it's own. Fierce Deity has a connection to Majora. So it's the closest you're going to get. Unless you count the Skull Kid costume. Just have Majora Mask form riding on the moon. He would grow the tentacles from the final boss fight and spin around. Welp... That's all your gonna get. How about just turning into Majora's Incarnate and going wild for a bit? The MM New 3DS is already sold out. I don't know. I kinda just want to see him dance around. They just announced it today! They need time to make some more! And then he'll make a bunch of weird high pitched squeals. I would love that. Dancing and squeals. Then everyone is dead. Hm... I'm going to have to buy Majora's Mask 3D and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the same day. And then my dad will have given me $50 by that point. And then I have money to buy the Majora's Mask DLC for HW. And then when the R.O.B. amiibos comes out pre-ordering that and I'm set. Because they want you to struggle. Lets see.. That's about... $280. If buying new. Yup. At least until you get a job. Then it's just a matter of time. Because I'm sick as in I'm not feeling good. Welp. Smash was delayed. If you watched one of Sakurai's Directs he says the games take a long time to make and he had to delay it to October. Your cousin has like the worst internet. So much lag and then he drops. Not to mention all he does is spam the same move. I mean his Pit is one of the poorest I've ever seen. Wait what? Me! What? How come I didn't get any? Thank you. Somebody could make that sound dirty.\n\nAlso Lana gets the Skull Kid costume?! What? I thought it would be like Link or Young Link? Back when Dragon Ball Z was the most popular anime, yes. Probably me. Spiking feels great. You just don't like getting spiked. Probably Smash. Unless I feel like playing MH. Unfair/lame? Tell that to tournament players and everyone who gets hyped when a spike happens? Spiking is something you do. It's not unfair and not lame. In fact it's some of the most exciting things to do. Welp. 4468-1425-4742 is my FC. Not put any effort? So risking your own self to jump off te edge where you enemy can knock you down just as much as you can to kill them isn't using effort? M'kay. Also disrespectful? I know spiking makes the other guy feel bad about getting spiked but disrespectful? Opponet air dodges and knocks you down. If you're fightng a pro it does. Oh no you don't. Well Monster Hunter isn't exactly a game for everyone. It's more of a game for those who are fans of the series. If you're new to the game... Well... You might like it or you might not like it. Because it's a command grab attack. I could see why you think that. But it's much more then that. But then again you aren't a fan of the series, so I can also see why you wouldn't understand that. It's also a command grab. It's the same as Diddy Kong's Side B. Command grab. They're grabs that are functioned to act like attacks. You mean like Link's? Monster Hunter actually. Well it's not you're playing the full game where you get all the cooler monsters and the Hardcore and Extreme ranks which leads to fightng multiple monsters at once and dealing with bigger threats as you try and survive by getting better weapons and armor only to be destroyed by the monsters and going back out to try again. Once you get into the higer ranks, the game becomes an all new beast. One-Hit KO attacks from monsters, monsters can grab you, monsterz can poison, paralyze,  put you to sleep, and all kinds of other stuff. Not to mention when you get to the super monsters. No. They function as grabs. With the new Insect Glaive weapon. And since you don't try, you don't get better. It's just how the attacks power and frames work. Which I'm also going to play. You can probably DI after the grab hits but I wouldn't know for sure. Because it does. I would play but I think Alex wants to do a 1v1. So yeah. Welp. Sure. Yes it does. If I could... The Monster Hunter one. From the NES Zelda. That's why I said... If I could. Yup. I thought Link or Young Link would have the costume. But Young Link? He would make the most sense to get the costume. He is the one that has the most connection to Skull Kid. True.  Sure. Welp. Oh baby... You kinda abandoned me. And Dane is a terrible partner. He offers no support. I always end up by myself. I am the Terminator. And you have been targeted for terminization! Not even SSJ Goku could stop R.O.B. Sure. *plays dramatic beat from the Terminator movie* If only...  Alrighty. 55-0915-4563-1051 Are you in? New room. 04-5655-5036-1261 Tetsucabra and Experienced. New room. 50-2511-1748-8990\n\nKeeps changing me. What was it? If only he was in Smash... Oh. Of course. Oh well... It's not his fault. It's just people are immature on the interent. Like always. Welp. Then what would be the point? Just to show it to your friends when they come over to your house? Ah. I don't know. I'm tried of playing MK for now. Lost your innocence? Oh... Well that sucks... I wish you didn't have to go through that...  Well at least things are now peacefulish. Welp. I think that would be something we all would miss. Unless you had an absolutely terrible childhood. Well that's good. I can barely remember what my childhood was like but I can remember some moments but mostly I remember just playing my video games and having a fun time. Reshiram? I just recently caught mine in OR. Ah I see. Sounds fine. M'kay. They get a bunch of copyright strikes and I think their channel might be taken down. Why would you need to ask? That killed the cat you know. Ever hear the saying \"Curiousity killed the cat.\"? I think I've gotten better then Silver with R.O.B. Because people will fight to stay at the top of the ranking. Making each more and more intense. That's the point. Everything is a paradox. Food is for those that are strong. Then it's true that the statement is false. Yeah... I just noticed. Exactly. Because I fixed it. Why do you keep changing my text flair? Yeah I know. I had to changing back to M.Metagross because Brett kept changing it. I will play. Who turned team smash off? I guess you guys couldn't hande the Megaman and Sonic team. Mega Man and Sonic. New team right there. Yup. I think Itachi just abandoned Turtle. Oh yeah! It works.  Gotta go Fast! Nope. You don't get better unless you try to fight what's better then you. I will. Just let me finish up this match. So you learn to get yourself moving.  Yup. It's how I learned. Which is why you don't get better. MEGA MAN! The Super Fighting Robot! I guess. But that can be said for anyone. Didn't seem like it. All I saw from your Ness was PK Fire. So fix that. Oh yeah! So fight  more stronger enemies. THE FASTEST SUPER FIGHTING TEAM IN THE WORLD! That doesn't seem like you're trying. Welp. Wel you should do more to prove it. Alex... You kinda need to slow down with Sonic a bit because if you go in to hard I' m gonna be left alone. Except all doubles tournaments turn on Team Attack to make things fair and more strategic. I don't remember tournaments being the only place to play seriously. It proabably will. Or you play one of the most spammy characters in he game.\n\nLook Mario Sunshine made me dislike Bowser Jr. enough... But now that he's just a spamming character makes me just hate him. I don't remember anyone saying they were playing for fun. Guess who I'm not playing as.  So my point is solid. But I'm not playing as him right now. That doesn't I can't complain about HOW you use them. Whoops. Typo. All projectiles? What ever happened to the Slide, Mega Upper, Flame Sword, Slash Claw? I also don't use Mega Man's projectiles as much as you spam Bowser Jr.'s side B. You just don't like Mega Man do you?  Yes. But it's still a move you spam nonstop. Probably. Probably why he doesn't like Sonic either. Yes. Must go eat my food! Sure. I can battle later. Sure. Charging a Pro Controller. You really relyed on that confusion hax. That's not very good planning. Especially when Sableye comes in. But how are you going to know if there's a Sableye? Are you gonna wait for them to announce their team then change yours to win? Yeah no. You're gonna switch Espeon into Sableye? Doesn't seem like the best idea. I love that anime! Goddamit... What? You let that ruin it for you? Please it suprisingly has a good story and characters. You mean like a boing sound effect? Highschool DxD... Trust me... Has a lot of fanservice. And I mean a lot. But suprisingly it was an actual enjoyable story with nice characters. A few episodes. Nope. He's a pervert. But he does care about all his friends. It's not exactly a boosted gear. It's a legendary Dragon Gear. What?  Keep watching. Shit starts getting real.  Watched an episode of DxD again... And I picked the one with the fight between the main character who is one of Dragon Masters and his rival the other Dragon Master. Epic fight scenes... Now I remmeber why I liked this anime. The epic fights were epic. No. There is no dragon porn.  Yes Dragon Master. I could give you some more spoilers. Unless you actually want to watch the entire thing like I did. I still love how Issei(Main character) is powered up by the thought of someone hurting a female's body. Especially it's someone he's attracted to. But he just doesn't like girls getting hurt at all unless a girl did something really f'd up to him. Like the one that killed him when he thought he finally had a girlfriend. Fire Emblem also has tentacle monsters. Except perverted.  I know. But I got used to it. Except he's more in it for the breasts. He's a perverted knight. Well then. Well it's true. He has a girlfriend. And that would mean at some point he would have sex. And it's been established that he is a pervert. Not really. Especially since I don't FairyTail. Why not just jump using the buttons? I will. I don't know. Today is Captain Falcon practice for me. He already was part of my mains. Because the online would with people trying to play Modern Sonic stages with all the boosting on a 3D stage. The only reason the 3DS game can do it, is because it only has 2D gameplay unlike it's superior console brother. I have it. Pretty good. Yup. I wonder who else has it? I'm just making Doc Louis quotes for every character as if Little Mac had his own Codec/Palutena's Guidance. You saw one of them right?  https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiT1JApqQ\n\nThis is the first of the Doc Louis quotes. Yup. I will play. MegaGross, Heatran, Skarmory, Bisharp, Aegislash, and Klefki. Yeah your Marth is pretty good. What do you mean? I can't pick Little Mac with you people can I? No. Then you guys are gonna say I'm just in it for the wins. Who? I'd say it's a good 50/50. Mkp? Interesting. Yes! Finally! That was one of first things I saw! I was like \"Hold on... FEET?!\" But of course. Yes! Link brought it back! 2 on 1 but Link fought until the end! Of course it would. You're in a group of people who know what to do. Hurray for the Hero of Hyrule! Yeah. Just like how I still need to practice Lucina. How? 1. GG's \n\n2. Maybe. If I'm still here. Because you're fighting to win against people who are doing the exact same thing. No. The clutch is real. Yes I do. I don't think I'm the best with her and I want to get better. What? I have the Ocarina but I never used it. Besides I would never have the time to play the song. No. But I don't think I am. Which means I'm going to practice. I would never have enough time. That's because every two seconds your Bowser Jr. is on screen you can hear the car sound reving up. The Song of Time doesn't slow down time. It sends you to a certain point in time. I would have to play the Reverse Song of Time to that. I guess but the thing is still annoying when, by your comparison, an airplane is flying at your face every two seconds. Hey man. Just gotta keep the facts straight. And besides the Link in Smash isn't even Ocarina of Time Link. He's more Twilight Princess so he can't even have the Ocarina. And even then only Young Link in Majora's Mask would know the Reverse Song of Time. Roy isn't even in the game man. Ike is better. Well you could change to Jump Art then recover. Maybe he didn't even mean Koopaling Roy.  So he finds Bowser Jr. annoying but will play as his alternate? Maybe he didn't. Seems fun. Should try and make the stage. If I go back in time, then you will have the damage you had at that point in time. The damage won't carry over. Maybe I don't want to... Really? Do you have it done or do you mean you're going to make the stage? Have you ever played Majora's Mask? In Ocarina of Time it got rid of certain blocks and opened the Door of Time. Because in Majora's Mask... It takes you back through time. I thought Smashketball would be fun. Until Aden decided to be a dick about it. I remember that time. Me. Sure. Smash. I'm there! Oh well. Too bad you're going to die. Or you're just bad with Mario. Because she is. Well then. I don't know about that. It doesn't seem very hard for me to grab Rosalina. You just have to pick the right moment. You should try wall jumping. But the fact is you're still gonna die. And who says you can't die tommorow? Or the day after that? Well Mario has been one of my mains since Smash 64. It happens for me a bunch. Probably because I've already hit Luma with a projectile first. Then run in for the grab. But you still gotta max out your characters levels. Turtle made FNAF plushies to make money. I guess. Yeah that place is hard... But you still have to get all your characters to level 150. Then when Majora's Mask DLC comes out... Level 200...  Yup.  What? I can play. Alrighty then. Sure. I can try. Oh. Right. Club Nintendo going away. I'm sure he had a good time. Well then.. Alrighty. Well... So I had a Smash room up and soneone on my friends list named Lisa came up. So start off nice and simple and I pick Sonic and start the match. She is playing Shulk... I knock her the stage and she just falls... Doesn't even try to recover and that happens for two more stocks then I win. Then next match I'm Lucina and she is Shulk again. We end up in the normal Boxing Ring and she has items on. Match starts and the lazer gun appears. She picks it up and I shield. All she does is stand there and shoot. I grab and proceed to kill her. She barely even trys to fight and only attacks when she isn't near me. She did nothing but spam Backslash and Air Slash. Then when she is about to lose she quits the match and leaves the room. I've never seen a worse Smash noob... I think... Then Shiek will take her place. Then Diddy Kong. Then Rosalina again. Hey look R.O.B. is #28! I don't know... Maybe I want a noob to complete destroy.... Yeah. Too fast for them to think. I wish R.O.B. would be #1 someday... Mario is 15! Nice! With my luck I would run into tournament level players every game. Yes we can. Well he's Mario! I can try!  Oh my god... Robby has some of the laggiest WiFi... But then that's not 100% completion... Actually it was an accidental attack. Yes. Levels don't matter? I don't think you've played an RPG or a Dyansty Warriors game before... You those levels. True completion is doing everything in a game. As long as something isn't max it isn't over. I don't see any glasses... Not really. Well that's the point. They want you playing the game as long as possible. Nope. Must not be Toshiro. It won't be years. There are certain missions that can make it go faster. Like the Rack Up The KO Count missions. Just get the Magic Jars, go into Focus Spirt, kill stuf, level up. Will be faster will +Exp skill. *shrugs* It doesn't have a message. Just kill everything! Okay? Yup. That's the friend code. Looks like Toshiro is a Smash noob. I know. Yay? *laughs* Wanna play Smash? Detective work. Because people want to use the new Megas more? So apparently the executive producer of Tecmo Koei, the people behind Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, and Hyrule Warriors have considered the idea for a Mario and Pokemon version of the Warriors series since Hyrule Warriors did well in the West. It is. I know. Just bringing it up. It fit for Zelda because they already used medival weapons. I can imagine a Mario version with Mario just straight up punching Super Mario 64 style and having his fireballs as well. You obviously aren't thinking hard enough. No. Pokemon Conquest is like Final Fantasy Tatics. If you're going by that then yeah. But if you're goin by people who play by Smogon then he's gone. I can see Mario and Pokemon working. Hah. Funny. Not really. Zelda made sense because it used medival weapons to begin with. The Warriors isn't always have to be japanese based medival fighting. It can change and it has begun to change. I would love to see Mario beating up Goombas and Koopas with punches straight ot of Super Mario 64. He probably would. Maybe King Boo too. Bowser would be the Ganondorf of the game. I can see it.  Fireballs yes. Wizzro shoots energy balls. That could just be a side thing for Mario. Or he can use his hammer for one of his combos. That's what I've been thinking. And finally somebody else who can Mario! Yes. That's my favorite song in the game. He could be in a Paper Mario DLC pack! Or an unlockable character in it's own Adventure Mode! I knew I could figure something out. Special attack could be could be a giant hammer swing or he gets a Giant Mushroom and stomps. Focus Spirit could be Mario adding a fire element to his attacks like he will start glowing red. Nah. Bowser has to be the final boss. Dimentio would be a good replacement for Cia though. I should go work on this game for Nintendo and Tecmo Koei. Gardevoir! Welp. There's my wife right there. Time to put that amiibo into tournaments. Xion! Nah. Dimentio is a great puppet master. But Bowser in Dream Team knew he was being used so he kicked Antasma to the curb and took the Dreamstone for himself. Bowser has gotten smarter so he would know if Dimentio was using him. Look at that Seperior. That was my favorite starter in Unova. Poor Roxas... What is it? Because it won't let me see it.\n Pikachu, Gardevoir, and Suicune made it into Pokken Tournament! Welp... I know who I'm playing as. Bowser was never Dimentio's puppet. Dimentio had Luigi as a puppet. Oh... I was gonna play Gardevoir... I'm playing Gardevoir. If Metagross makes it in... My wallet is already dead. Well I am someone on the internet. I don't know. All my money seems to just fly away. I need a job... Fast. Well that's because he betrayed Count Bleck and had planted Luigi as his final phase for the final boss. It's been heavily implied to be ported to the Wii U by the developer. Well because evryone was told that Count Bleck was the big issue. So when Dimentio steals the show, it's pretty shocking to them. Can't wait for Pokken Tournament to hit the Wii U late 2015 or early 2016. Anybody want to 1v1 in Smash? In what? Smash? Ah. Welp. Okay. You make the room or me? Alright. I will be waiting. Alright. Hope your controls work out. Uh oh. Toshiro has just joined my Smash room. Toshiro can't recover for shit with Shulk. He just fell after I caught him in a combo with C.Falcon. Then I spiked him right after he came back.  He's a noob. I want to wreck him. Toshiro. Last time me and him had a match it lagged. Toshiro needs to learn how to turn items off. Yes because when I go to compete in tournaments, I'm going to have to use items. Wow. You guys don't even give me time to get back. Thanks.  Because I randomly just leave. And you could at least wait a minute before you decide he left. I wasn't even gone for a whole minute.  No. Because I expect everybody to be playing like they mean it. That's why I sat in the room for two fucking minutes while you guys were playing. Because my internet gooped. I don't leave after one match. I leave after a consecutive number. And would it kill to wait a whole 20 seconds to see if I come back? And you could or could not be an asshole. The purpose of having a choice. Patience is a virtue. That's why not many people have it. And it was more of the fact that you can't even give me 20 fucking seconds to come back. Would it kill to see if the dude is coming back or not? So you say you've waited longer? Yet when it comes to waiting if someone comes back, you can't even do that? Gotta Go Fast! I don't usually have people do this kind of stuff. I've always played against people who can wait a minute or two. So sorry if I'm used to people with manners. Gotta Go Fast! Fast Gotta Go Fast. Like that's easy. My emotions play a role in who I am and aren't exactly easy to keep down. I like playing Sonic. Also tell that to Cobi. Go Fast! Not really. You just said yourself you've learned to deal with it. A youtuber who plays a really good Sonic. So you're emotions play a role in who you are yet you adapted to not using them? I never said you didn't have any. I said you don't use them. Yes. M'kay. Sonic. Don't worry. It's the best form.\n\nJk. Yes. Xaldin? He was the one with the lances right? If so, it was an annoying fight... Yes it was. Xemnas I had no trouble with but Xaldin was just annoying to fight! I did it on my first try but only because Mickey had come to save my ass! Markiplier is the best. Well seems like you found your new favorite youtuber. That's his thing. He has weird hitboxes. Not really. It's just how he plays. I mean he's a flat 2D object in a 3D world so he would be moving weird. Yes it's okay to use him. Not with Guts. Guts would cause it to raise. Because they are trying to run another item like an Assault Vest Conk. Toxic Orb does less damage in the intial form. Flame Orb is better in the long run. Alright then. Just three stocked a dude's Greninja with Megaman. Caught him with Flame Blast when he dodged to get the kill every single time. Then he tried to fight me with his C.Falcon, and he got wrecked as well. Smashkett ball! Come on and slam! Best Mega Man in the world right there. Well it's Roxas letting it out to see if Sora is worth it. Yup. I know that nightmare. Looks like me. Yes. Yup. Oh for the lols. Who says you're fighting a competitive battle? Sounds like fun. Because you want to have some fun? You act like everyone has to play competitive every battle. Shit. Remind me not to piss off Snorlax. You're the kind of guy who thinks everyone has to play competitive. People can battle in different ways. Especially when I can talk to you and say \"Bring your craziest mons.\" Nice. I guess someone must have saw your request. That's not really crazy.  Shhhh...\n\nLet him find out on his own... You should probably try jumping more. He is not exactly good in the air and the only projectile he can throw that has a decent chance of hitting you is the bomb. That sounds sounds like generic OU team...\n\nBefore the the bans. :( It's happened to me a couple times. I've actually accepted a couple of times and the sounded like 10 year olds in a noisy house. She looks pretty! Too bad she's probably older then me and somewhere else in the world... Welp. I guess you no longer like Mega Man anymore. Yup. Mega Man! Super Fighting Robot! Yeah I've been there. Aw man... Guess I have to keep looking... Welp. Whelk Shofu quit Smash guys.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps-ZciKv9yo Pokemon hax at it's finest.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyqsV8pqEmE Shulk Dankey Kang It's more annoying then fearful. Mega. Wow. Snowy just fucking rage quitted after he lost. And he used such a nooby Fox too. Yup. That's all he did. Spam lasers, dash to the other side, spam lasers. You can gen? Nice. Ah. Does sound very annoying. Gen 1-6? So does that mean you can get me a Hyper Voice Gardevoir? Really? How? Weren't you Kirby? You should be able to catch up to Mega Man? But they Mega Man's lemons have a short range. And you could have jumped over him. Yay! I guess but the things won't hit you. Oh.

Marth gets all the bitties. and sheik has the ultimate wombo combo ScarfChomp is bout to go to that personal list of Pokemon I hate along with BandedTalon Weavile and Mamoswine are the only relevant Ice Shard users and neither have a place on my team *misses rest*\n\nThat was when Joah knew he fucked up Smash or oras battle anyone?

BL Ubers lol. No one is gonna use it Gaara has(d) a Tailed Beast. GG Toph Greninja doesn't have shit on Uber bulk. The only thing I think of Greninja checking in Ubers is maybe Rayquaza. Gunk Shot and Ice Beam don't OHKO Xerneas and Yvetal respectively. HP Fire doesn't KO Genesect. DDance Mence outspeeds Greninja.\n\nDummy.

You have supporters if you need them, and haters if you deserve them.\n\nIt's almost fun trying to defend your story. A lot of the people who doubt you have some incredibly irrational arguments, or just don't know how to do their own research. The only argument I haven't been able to refute is your supposed \"time traveling security cameras.\" My best guess is that you already had something rudimentary, designed for defense against intruders, and your brother set up cameras specifically for covering your arse. The way you worded a comment in your first post suggests to many that you already have interior security cameras and understood your first update post to mean your brother was setting up your only cameras. It's just fun to speculate over the possible explanations.\n\nPersonally, I think that, if you were the twelve year old so many people think you to be, you would have revealed yourself looong ago. No one immature enough to go through all of this effort would be mature enough to keep themselves from exposing their clever invention.\n\nAnd I've had some good laughs as people sunk as low as trying to insult me and *my* life, instead of maintaining focus on the argument.

Just utterly boring, repetitive gameplay - every mission is the same - go to point *x* and kill 10,000 of the same enemy on the way.  Reach point *x*.  Kill 10,000 more of exactly the same enemy.\n\nI mean, a lot of first person shooters are like that in a general sense, but with Destiny they don't even make an effort to convince you otherwise. Fate is a fickle bitch. *Bootylicious* was the third sign of the apocalypse, I am convinced. No.  The worst mall in the world is Morley Galleria.\n\nWe call it Morley Gonorrhea. I'm on a rig offshore - can the horsemen ride over water, or does it take them a while to wade out this far? Happy to try anything that is't Destiny or Call of Duty 5: Modern Warfare 8:  Advanced Warfare 2:  Ghosts 12:  Volume IV:  Part 1. I can just imagine the horrible scene.\n\nI am dead, but there is a bright light.  For some reason, I can still walk, so I walk towards it.\n\nThe light is discernible now - there's clouds, there's bright blue sky, and a gleaming set of golden gates guarding the way forward.  A man stands in front of it.  A very familiar-looking man with kind features, long hair and a beard is standing in front of the gates in a simple but brilliant white robe.\n\n\"Jesus!\" I exclaim, \"Wow, I didn't think I'd make it into Heaven!\".\n\nThe Saviour of Mankind looks pityingly at me, standing between me and the gate.\n\n\"I don't think you're ready...\" He says softly.\n\n\"But I am Lord!  I *am*!\" I say, throwing myself on His mercy.\n\nJesus sadly shakes His head says again \"I don't think you're ready...\".\n\n\"Lord!  Tell me what I must do!  I swear I'm ready!  I swear it!\".\n\nThe Son of God's features harden and take on a cruel facade.  A flash of sadistic pleasure crosses His eyes, before he stares into mine and seals my fate.\n\n\"I don't think you're ready...*for this jelly!*\".\n\nOh fuck me, I'm in hell. With a purchase price of $100 and over 5 gigs of downloads just when I first put the disk in?\n\nYeah, it outright fucking sucks. Forsooth, I do, verily aye. $100 when I bought it.  I only have the base game, and the 5 gigs of updates and crap it had to download on install before it even said \"push start\".\n\nThere's basically twelve enemies in the entire game, and the only thing that changes is whether you kill 10,000 identical mooks trudging toward the next stupid checkpoint, or whether you have to kill waves of 10,000 identical mooks (or both).\n\nPeople always crap on about the guns and the graphics - guns and graphics are about 10% of the experience of playing a good game.  Storyline, dialogue, plot twists, character development and atmosphere contribute a hell of a lot more.\n\nIf I'd bought the thing for $10 as an essentially \"freemium\" game with DLC I could buy to expand it, it'd be less of an issue.  $100 and a bunch of shit I have to download just so it will *play* with nothing added is utter bullshit.\n\nHence, Destiny outright fucking sucks.\n\n I imagine Zuckerberg can get anyone he wants to fuck or suck him outright. Had to google who that was - lost interest when I saw the first line of the search results:\n\nSteven (Destiny) Bonnell II is a professional streamer...\n\nGreat, another PewDiePie-esque fuckstick. Can't believe I live in a world where the word \"professional\" is a prefix to \"streamer\". All of the above, plus Destiny's Child, just to round things out. I got the receipt right here if you want me to scan / photograph it.\n\nBought from the EB Games in the Enex100 building on November 7th, 2014 for $99.95.\n\nAt the exchange rate today, that's US $79.  On that date, it was $86 (http://www.exchange-rates.org/Rate/AUD/USD/11-7-2014).\n\nEither way, still too much to pay for an utterly and completely average game at best. Australia tax, we get ripped off for everything. They always claim it's because it costs more to ship everything to Australia, which is complete horse shit given that they charge the same if you get it off itunes or whatever digital service. Pretty much the same as retail - though they do have better sales on the Xbox store.  Twice nothing is still nothing, however. Never played it so I can't comment.  At least the concept of combining mechs and first person shooting is something different.\n\nDestiny is just Call of Duty in space, except crappier and with less variety.", "topic_full": "cowboys right fuck just know football man play game did", "label": "MexicanSpaceProgram", "topic_id": "topic_5", "topic_distr": [0.00030036886361321129, 0.00030038970070364075, 0.00030037358944741302, 0.00030036985031416634, 0.00030037556404647204, 0.99729662259162566, 0.00030037211103931563, 0.00030037399473632547, 0.00030036567447529812, 0.00030038805999855643], "mean_infl": 0.00031867408974510427}], ["panameboss", {"topic_repr": "play fuck let", "text": " Here we are finally!!\n\nEdit: Hype ting What ever happened to the proof OP promised?", "topic_full": "play fuck let game good right cowboys know love lol", "label": "panameboss", "topic_id": "topic_1", "topic_distr": [0.011112644377915475, 0.89998525757345149, 0.011112615297266546, 0.011112532685839943, 0.011112428494651437, 0.01111280726650396, 0.011112912575222173, 0.011113078256917163, 0.011113368345930496, 0.011112355126301434], "mean_infl": 0.0006703527164494142}], ["broooks77", {"topic_repr": "fuck cowboys know", "text": " LETS GO RAVENS!

He knows what losing meant, another 8-8 joke, another choke gesture, and another year wasted for his Master Jones 5000 year lifespan which only has a few years left. Fresh from his surgery and lack of recovery time, his back is aching, and Tony knows that it won\u2019t hold out for much longer. But still, he has to try. He knows he isn\u2019t the best QB by a long shot, but he isn\u2019t going to give in the despair in front of him. The clock is still ticking, 16, 15, 14\u2026.\n\n\n\nSuh turns around and sees a stir on the limp body behind him. How dare he get up so quickly? His thoughts quickly racing to form a punishment for the QB that\u2019s now on his elbows. A smirk flashes across his face. Master Jones sees it and tries to warn Tony, but he is too late.\n\n\n\nA thundering crack loud enough to shake the stadium fills the air. Everyone in the crowd and sidelines are silent. Tony Romo is lying lifeless on the ground as a leg is on top of him, every bone in his back broken and his organs smashed together, the ground around his body caved in with cracks spread along the edges. Suh laughs loudly and maniacally.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho is going to save you now?\u201d He shouts between his laughter, \u201cNo one can stop me now!\u201d\n\nThe clock is still ticking, only 9 seconds remaining.\n\n\n\nThen, a slight twitch jerks Suh\u2019s leg. He looks down, confused. Tony\u2019s arm is moving now, trying to do a pushup to get to a sitting position. Suh puts more force on his legs, trying to put Tony down once more, but he feels like he is trying to push down a mountain. Helplessly he tumbles down as Tony gets up from his grasp and calls a no huddle formation play, shock displaying from his face.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what is happening?\u201d Coach Garrett asks confusingly, \u201chow, how can he get up from that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLegend foretold of a super QB, with skills and powers so great that not even the steel curtain defense can stop.\u201d Master Jerry Jones starts to reminisce, \u201cbut that QB was never seen, and for the longest time we all thought it was just a urban legend.\u201d The master starts to tear up, \u201cbut I was wrong, the super QB has finally risen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTony Romo is the one\u201d\n\n\n\nTony snaps the ball with just 2 seconds left on the play clock, he waits for his WRs to run the 75 yards Hail Mary route. The Lions rushes 4, Suh is double teamed but Ansah manages to break his blocker and has an easy sack on Tony Romo. Just when Ansah wraps himself around Tony, Tony grasps Ansah\u2019s collar and lifts him up in the air with his left hand like his lifting a small baby, and tosses him backwards into the Cowboys\u2019 goalpost. Tony finally sees Dez open running towards the endzone, and he powers up to throw a line drive straight to dez, his left foot planting a huge crater in the ground. Just then Suh jumps up to block the ball and both of his hands are blocking the path, ready to swap the ball on the ground. However, when the ball reaches Suh\u2019s hands, it just tears both of his hands from his arms and keeps going in a straight line right towards Dez. Dez caught the ball at the Lions 20 yard line in a horizontal leap, but the ball\u2019s power propels him toward, and dez lands in the endzone both feet in for a touchdown. The crowd is only silent for a second before the cheers filled the entire stadium.\n\nSo a super QB was born in the lands. The cowboys would go 8-8 in their next 25 years.\n\n", "topic_full": "football game sure lol play win team didn shit cowboys", "label": "kinwah", "topic_id": "topic_4", "topic_distr": [0.33381111847639416, 0.00028497448235438794, 0.00028497536236434207, 0.00028497704700957858, 0.66390912379649947, 0.00028496483072786808, 0.00028497079469021994, 0.00028498347204848829, 0.00028495397913449273, 0.00028495775877700359], "mean_infl": 0.0004759689234008781}], ["Bidoofdude", {"topic_repr": "game going shit", "text": " I haven't cut my fingernails in years.

Stupid Dallas \"Why wasn't it a first down?\"\n\n\"Well it was behind the yellow line, Jason\" Green Bay was likely selling out on the run (sending everybody in the box to stop it) so Dallas thought they'd have better chances with the pass.\n\nWhy they went for it all, I don't know. A crossing route over the middle probably would've beat that coverage. \"Dish has dropped Fox News\"\n\nGood. Where do I give them my money? No, because the play was whistled dead before it was snapped, so technically the play never occurred. Dallas really just fucked themselves with that timeout. The same kind of person who asks why a touchdown is six points. Oh my god he was wide open.  That was the prettiest looking field goal I've ever seen. It's hard to not like Russell Wilson. This whole Ice Bowl II thing is fucking stupid. Blue cheese heads lol Romo is a fucking warrior. Lambeau isn't loud at all. I love the Lions fans in this thread. Thanks homie. Hopefully we can do it. Goooooooood :) If Dez would've just secured that ball and not gone for the endzone, Dallas wins. I think that was a very selfish play by Dez, trying to take everything on 4th down.

The Lions Dline is legit as fuck It's at the 1 CM line HOLY FUCKING SHIT Is that 2012 RGIII or Matt Stafford? Bell is a beast. Damn. Stafford is so good at evading sacks Oh, that is just a great run by Bush God damn, the Lions are looking great on both sides of the ball The Lions just scored from the ball being on their own 1 cm line.

Only OL members get flairs corresponding to their position, not to their person.\n\nYou're breaking the rules. \"flairs corresponding to their **position**, not to their **person**.\"\n\nAnd I've tried to fix the flair text. Nothing works. :/ &gt;-NO ASKING FOR CUSTOM FLAIRS. Only OL members get flairs corresponding to their position, not to their person.\n\nK99's breaking the rules if he gives him that flair.

Are all amazing Psychic types.\n\nAnd for your one non-uber Legend there's: Cresselia, Lake Trio, Mew, and Jirachi.  I'd have my powers removed most likely. :( Kev's a dick, it looks likes shit, Nee attacked us, Kev lets Toshiro on the Subreddit but not us, no challengers, shit AF. Sigilyph, Metagross, M-Medicham, Espeon, Slowking, Volcarona (WC)\n\nWith ORAS, I'd have used M-Gallade instead and swapped Sking for Sbro. Sadly, it is true. Idfk. It did have Magic Guard. :p Indeed. Sigilyph. Once it sets up, it's OP AF. Exactly. Use it. Alakazam is better w/Sash or Specs.

They ban everything good. They were designed to be that way. Then Smogon scrub's cry that they're too OP. :/ Yes. Yes I am. It may OP AF, but people still have the right to use it. No, I'd say the person using them was stupid. Exactly. Kek. liek Sanic ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) :D Why? I didn't say anything... :] I know. It's Ian.

Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay. Who's Jamue? ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) Yes. But your comment was also gay. I was. ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) K99 isn't gay. I was talking about K99. I know Bowen is. So did Turtle. ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) Are Turtle and Silver the only people here who's real names are still unknown?

If you *really* do, PM me it. If you don't PM me it, you don't know it. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees. Y-E-S YES YES YES YES YES! I give 0 fucks about the DE. :} Fuck math. What's going on over there? My guess: nothing. Can you make me an approved submitter? I don't care about any powers. Don't make it look good. D: Nuuuuuh! This one has to look better. Kev said he wanted to work on that one, and if he's too lazy to do it, don't do it for him. :/ :/ Can you make me an approved submitter on the DE Subredit? I don't care about mod powers. So why can't you let me be a submitter? I won't even post there. I just wanna see it. But I wanna look at the posts and stuff. :/\n\nSilver got let in and he has powers, he could ruin the place (which he won't). I won't be able to do any damage. And if Kev doesn't want me there, he can remove me afterwards. :D It's not my fault he decided to go mental at me for no reason. :} It is. http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr9nn1apO81qknbv6.gif [Congratulations.](http://i40.tinypic.com/206oraq.jpg) You were correct again.

I know that, why'd you bring him up? When did Red die? Then how do you know he died? Ikr. I can see it. I'm not a mod, just a Submitter. The same. Except the comment boxes are now grey.

I think we should do something like their Set of the Week, but in a post, and have it where people can share cool sets and stuff.\n\nAnd this. Which was? http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlyEighteen/comments/2q30tn/posts_system/cn36gcn lel Ikr. They know this Subreddit is better, but rather than admit it, they're stealing our ideas. :( Nah, we should copyright our shit. :p\n\nWe shouldn't have to change our league because of them. Eh, we thought of it first. That's what he did to me. Only because he couldn't unmod me before that, and after I left and rejoined, he could. :( How? That's when Kev wasn't a dick. If I had known how it would turn out, I never would have done that. Give us Pokemon for flairs now. They still have them shitty flairs that look like ours. :/\n\nAnd nobody knows how to do the flair text thing. *Gives Reddit gold* Ok, who should make it? :} They'll look better than these flairs. And if we do it before the DE, they'll be copying us when they do, and if they have to copy our ideas it shows this league is better. :D Espeon&gt;Xatu Now links look ugly AF. :( This green is too bright. :/ It's because his Thundurus flair is smaller than ours. The bigger the flair, the closer the text. That's exactly why I've wanted sprites all along. :p  When you're an elite. Because if you have flairs, challengers will get confused. We're getting Pokemon Sprite flairs. Why me? ._. Bcus. :} Who says I look at porn? I send it to other people, I never said I look at it. ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) Noh, sowwy. You tried to use the M-Pinsir image on it's own, you can't do that. .-.\n\nYou have to put all the sprites on to a spritesheet. You can't, only Patrick can unless you make your spritesheet. So can I.

Fuck off! :D Noh, I'd like a game with good graphics *and* good gameplay and storyline. es byootiful :}\n\nJust stating the obvious. No, AAA is Fairy. Noh. OoT 3D, Hyrule Warriors, MM 3D all have better graphics. Kthxbai. Yes it is. It's a **Zelda** and Dynasty Warriors crossover. It's still real. :/\n\nJust because it's a crossover, doesn't make it fake. You said it wasn't a real Zelda game.\n\nFake = isn't real.

That would take up the entire screen. :p That would be more fitting as it's X,X,X,X,X,Y combo. They should of made Fierce Deity Link a costume at least. *Majora's Wrath. Hahahahahaha!

Combining the two will make things even harder. Plus, what about all the elites at the DE whose types are already taken here? Not to mention the fact this place is already better, this would give Kev more time to do fuck all, as this Subreddit is already good. ? So I'll lose my Full Permissions and Kev will get them, even though he doesn't fucking help? And let's be honest, more people listen to Kev than K99. Whatever he says will go, the we'll have a repeat of last time. Kev already said he wanted gone from the start, why would we now, after we've created a better league turn around and team up with him? He manipulates the other DE's (like Ian) to get what he wants. He kicked us out then invited Toshiro in to his league. This means we'll have to be nice to Toshiro, or Kev will accuse us of bullying and ban us. This is not a good idea. Ech. Orly? It's a waste of time? Then bother at all? Why complain about the ban if it's \"a waste of time\"?\n\nAnd you only want to make it public so you can get more people on your side, and at the end of the day, I'm not the one using other to people to get my messages across. \n\nOn a side note, you found it perfectly easy to write a whole paragraph of hate about me and then say that to my face. Why can't you do the same now? 1 Legend. You couldn't use Moltres and Zapdos. Mega Pidgeot... It's still good. You may not have invited him, but you still let him on the Subreddit, whilst half the actual elites weren't allowed to see it. Eh... I did, like 3 weeks ago, it's a private Subreddit where people are randomly selected to join. ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) I didn't say I was leaving to do that. And I didn't start the shitstorms, the last one was caused by Teenelmo, not me. But you'd like to blame me, so I may as well say it was me. I know CSS, that logic is invalid. Ian isn't a mod anymore. He's doing nothing, he's letting everyone else do work. Just proves their Subreddit is so bad they need to steal our CSS. Exactly, you were correct. And then unlike the DE, we **improved** it. Kev did a bunch of basic CSS, then thought \"I can't be bothered, if they want it to look good, they can do it themselves\". Ech. :p How would you know? I never asked CSShelp. .-. Kek. Amoozing. :p xD How do I unlock more costumes in Hyrule Warriors from Adventure Mode? Idfk, I think so...\n\nOr maybe I'm being stupid. Can you even unlock more Costumes?

Does it HAVE to have that move, because they can just pull a Swagger and ban the mmove Well shit hit the fan Reminds me of one of the  logic fallacies.\n\n\n &gt;Slippery Slope: This is a conclusion based on the premise that if A happens, then eventually through a series of small steps, through B, C,..., X, Y, Z will happen, too, basically equating A and Z. So, if we don't want Z to occur, A must not be allowed to occur either. Example:\n\n&gt;If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban Hummers. Good idea, however, I can see some \"holes\" in it.\n\n1. If we leave 2 people with 2 different oppinions (ex. Toshiro thing I read earlier in the comment chain), how would we get anywhere in that situation.\n\n2. Wtf is the point of combining the leagues? Unless Elites keep their spot here AND there, thus allowing for 2 types per Elite, there would be no point.

Heres a crazy strategy that some guy did with his:\n\"I trained my amiibo on special smash with 300% handicap and high gravity. This has taught him to dodge every single attack like his life depends on it, as assure to that every attack is made to kill. The unintended side effect of high gravity is that he learned the importance of quick recovery, along with the knowledge of keeping his opponents off stage is a good strategy. He always tried to knock people off, obviously, but it wasn't until I trained him with high gravity that he would actively keep them away from getting back on and will occasionally go for a meteor smash. \nI also trained him on a custom stage thats just a large box and the only way to kill people is to smash them through a two grid block opening from the top. This has taught him extreme accuracy and lightning fast reflexes. Because of the closed quarters, we started bouncing off the walls quickly. He adapted to that speed and can effortlessly smack me out of it, or into the air as I'm mid launch even at 999%. He always learned to smash people specifically where he wants them to go. He had problems getting me through the opening at first, but now can do it seemingly without trying. The opening is as wide as marios idle position. my amiibo can throw me up to through it, utilt, uair, and smash me through it, at an angle too, he can even ricochet me off a wall and still get me through it.\nI can no longer beat my amiibo in any situation, what else should I do to continue his training?\" [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2dlKNrnZ84) U don't even play et You can also run HP Rock/Ice for Flying types.

Well fuck Xaldin, just let me grind for an hour and train my gaurding on Marluxia. ...It's clear you don't know how supportive this Poke actually is.

Wonder who Smoon Bird is, since T-flame is named muh priority thatsthejoke.jpg Yep Roxas needs to calm the fuck down with these combos If I had a dollar for everytime Roxas beats me.\n\n\nUnlike Xaldin, the fight isn't annoying, it's challenging because you need to know when to guard and when you can attack, and he attacks very quickly. I know, and even on Standard, he's hard as hell.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen again I'm like Level 43 lol, I got him down to 1 bar left. McDonalds. OH COME ON GAME I GUARDED THAT AND YOU KNOW IT!

He kept a thick, brown mustache all his life. My Aunt would tell me stories about how all the firefighters loved him--Uncle Den always had them call him by his first name, even though he was the Chief--but he didn't pull any punches and commanded respect from his men. There were stories about him having to jump from a burning building before the roof caved in. He never talked about this too much; he was a mans man.\n\nWhen I was a kid I'd go over to his house for Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners. He'd cook food all day, but he'd always make time to come into the computer room with me whenever I had a problem with Command and Conqueror or Sid Meier's Pirates! He was there for me in other ways.\nShortly after my parents divorce, I had problems sleeping. I was staying over at his house one night, and went downstairs to talk to him in the wee hours of the morning. He was always up late reading sci-fi books in his recliner. We sat there in the family room, and he just listened to me. I can't remember what he said but I never had any problems sleeping after our talk.\n\nUncle Den got esophageal cancer four years ago. He only had a few weeks to live after he found out. I dropped everything I was doing and drove up to California to visit him in his final days. Uncle Den was a big guy all his life, but within a matter of weeks he had already lost a lot of weight and become emaciated--he couldn't eat solid foods due to the cancer, it had become too painful. When I visited him he would always cook me breakfast and we'd sit around the kitchen table and talk for hours. Even though he couldn't eat, he still insisted on cooking us breakfast, and we still talked.\n\nThose days I spent with him were somehow great. We had those conversations that you never have when someone is healthy. I told him how I loved him like a father; he told me he loved me like a son. We did our best to act like men, but we both cried. I'd never seen Uncle Den like this, and it was shocking seeing this strong of a man scared about dying. It taught me a lot of things. As tough as those days were I don't regret them, and I know Uncle Den didn't regret them. The finality of death has a way of breaking down those superficial barriers we erect around our hearts so we can speak the truth. Look at the name of the author.

Dear Lions fans, I hope you're ready for Buck and Aikman to barely acknowledge your existence in this game. Damn that was a shot. Uhoh...

Nice tackle.\n\n\"I bumped into you, why didn't you go down?\" Thankfully, we'd at least get open stadium Stafford. I was so scared of Dallas... If DET scores, this is gonna be like a 99.99 yard drive. Goddamn it Dallas, I really wanted to play CAR next week. Darell Tapp? As in former Seahawk Darell Tapp? Dude's still around... Dallas needs a TD on this drive. Someone please tell me Dallas' Oline is just playing like complete shit, I really don't want DET's front to be this good. Holy shit, Cowboy offense. Would've only been 5 yards anyway, but that should've been a flag. If the ball's is tipped you can run into the kicker, otherwise you're not allowed to touch them at all when they're in the kicking motion. Still don't understand why the fuck Jerry thought it was a good idea to have a giant fucking window in a stadium FACING WEST. Do you notice how the players are staring into the sun right now? Wouldn't be a problem if the stadium ran north to south, like most do. And with that, Lions fans' buttholes everywhere puckered up. Question, are there any other subs that consistently fuck Reddit servers as much as /r/nfl's threads? BECAUSE WHY THE FUCK WOULDN'T YOU RUN THE BALL??? Jesus Dallas... You had your opportunity Dallas, and you completely shit it away. I love how AT&amp;Ts bar chart just lists \"Other guys\", who the fuck are the other guys? Hmm, probably should've done that when you were 3rd and 2 in the redzone... Please don't piss this away Dallas. 2 yards to go, better pass it here... Thank you Dallas, you didn't blow it!!! Remember when Terrence Howard didn't wanna do Iron Man 2 because he thought he was better than that? Yeah... Dear Romo, please don't Romo this... THERE'S the Lions we all know and love. Has Romo thrown a single pass away at all? Well done Romo. Well done... lol, good call bringin that out. LOL, Jerry called in a favor. Sadly, that's not saying much. Not sure what's more frustrating right now, Romo struggling in the redzone, or Reddit's servers. As someone who doesn't wanna face Detroit's front seven, I'm okay with the refs propping up Dallas right now. When we weren't playing our best, and the D was banged up. Would rather face them then Detroit right now. They should probably suspend all those players next week just to be safe. \"Second flag was a personal foul on Dallas, we decided to pick that one up.\" I'm truly enjoying my first football stress-free weekend in 9 weeks!

I'm calling fumble recovery for TD. Hochuli's slowly losing it... I'm glad to see Carlson hasn't progressed from his Seattle days... like at all.

Saying \"you're gonna want to go ahead and\" in EVERY SINGLE YOUTUBE VIDEO YOU MAKE Now you've assumed i'm European/the rest of the world's countries are cluttered together? America is only ~200km wider than Australia (where i'm from) from easternmost to westernmost. I can drive for days and still be in the same state.\n\nThe average Australian, who has never left Australia, will be able to tell you about Australia's states and territories, as well as stuff about America/England/China/Africa/others. You've only helped prove my point that **as a massive generalisation**, Americans are self-centred and ignorant. You think the rest of the world gives a flying fuck about your constitution/founding fathers? Nah, but for some reason we still know about it.\n\nWhy would you assume someone is American until proven otherwise, when it makes more sense/works better to acknowledge and accept you don't know where someone is from until you've been told? However on this front, i was generally meaning on the internet, where race, colour, accents and other defining features are moot. Americans often assume others are also from America, with zero proof other than the ability to speak english. I'm from Australia and it's much the same situation. [This is the sort of thing i'm talking about though.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYjjynROFuI) A lot of these questions are just general knowledge about the world, but these Americans are clueless. (I know, it's just a compilation of the worst/best answers, but it illustrates my point.) Americans seem to be so proud of having created the internet, why don't you guys use it to learn a bit about the world? Recently finished high school, on a 3 month holiday. It's 3:47am. Insomniac. Out of weed. Yes i know i'm generalising, but so is everyone on this thread. I even pointed out that it was a generalisation, and bolded it. This post is about customs, and it's fairly obvious that not every single citizen is going to follow said customs, so generalisations are inevitable here. \n\nOn social media websites, there is no \"culture of that website\", specifically aimed at a certain demographic. There are many. Yeah, reddit is an American website, built by an American, but it's on the internet which is a worldwide infrastructure. [Here is a graph of Reddit's userbase](http://ignitesma.s3.amazonaws.com/ignitewebsite/social-network-analysis-2012/Reddit_top_regions_2012.png.png), and the mere existence of subreddits like /r/Australia and /r/straya illustrate that this is not just an American website, but a multinational, multicultural one. It doesn't help that our government tries to copy the US in any way possible, including the current attempt at REMOVING our excellent healthcare system... Australia as a country tries to compare itself to the US &gt; it's usually thousands of miles away and not covered in our media.\n\nThis leads me to believe that those running your media are American-centric? Or are just catering to the public demand of American news over worldwide news?\n\nedit: I also don't think you're correct in saying Australia is largely unsettled, it's just that the middle of Australia is a big fucking desert, and not that many people want to live in the middle of a desert which lacks a Las Vegas type environment. any Kipkay video I know right, is it really that much effort to say? Can confirm I didn't get taught that in school. I guess i'm saying it's just a sort of common knowledge in (some) other countries, where it has absolutely no need to be. Technically, the indigenous Australians/aborigines own ALL the land in Australia, but the British colonies stole it. We usually have to start official ceremonies and things by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land, such as the ______ tribe.

I wish I could get a study to you, but I'm on mobile at the moment, my computer broke. In the UK, the police can get there quickly since its a small country. The nearest police station to me is almost 20 minutes away. And yet, for some inexplicable reason, more people die in car accidents than shootings, weirdly enough. Election after election after election. Sarcasm It's sarcasm Well here in the US, if we were to ban guns we would wind up like Mexico. Once they're there, it's impossible to get rid of them. 1st we don't have any automatic weapons. Those are specifically banned.\n\n 2cd the comparison would remain valid, not because of the lack of follow through by the police, but the fact that they would get rid of the police's guns, and the criminal gangs would have guns, because they're criminals, they don't follow the law, and it would be short ranged tazers against guns. The police would be powerless. \n\nAnd that's the only way to get citizens to follow a permanent gun ban, get rid of the police's guns. People are already whipped into a frenzy about police brutality, they wouldn't want the same police, who in their eyes killed innocent people, to be armed, and they unarmed. Only semi, and I see where your coming from. Reason for bankruptcy, not death. It's illegal for a hospital to not treat someone who needs it and wants it. Under \"life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness\".\n\nThey can charge you a shit ton for it sure, medicine is expensive as hell. The problem is not corporate lobbying. It's big businesses lobbying with campaign funds.\n\nA corporation is a legal entity that handles its own debt and finances. Meaning that if you own a business, and that business goes under and goes bankrupt, they can't come up and take your house. They can take anything that belongs to the corporation, but not YOU.\n\nYou mean the same thing, but corporate lobbying means essentially any business (most businesses are corporations, if the owners have any idea what they're doing) that lobby's itself, including the small ones. Business owners are people too and deserve to have their problems heard.\n\n\n What on earth?\n\nHollow point rounds are atrocious! They rip people apart! It's a guaranteed kill, but it's a messy, inhumane, slow, death. They are BANNED by the federal government for that reason! Hollow point ammo. Hollow point means that there is a hole at the start of the ammunition, which makes it absolutely rip through someone in a very gruesome manner. Imagine your arm being ripped off on half a second. Then compare that to having a hole jabbed through it, that's the difference.\n\nRegular ammo is fine, hollow point is excessive, and may be banned in warfare, I need to check up on that. So? That means you are legally allowed to give him a slow torturous death of having your internals ripped out?  That's what hollow point ammo does, its absolutely vicious stuff against flesh.\n\nGive him the courtesy of not bleeding out slowly thank you. If you aim for the center of mass with a hollow point, the same thing happens, hollow points are extremely vicious, I would not wish one of them onto my worst enemy. \n\nImagine having your internals ripped out of you, you're essentially a human bomb and your internals go EVERYWHERE.\nOh, and you don't even get to die quickly, you have to wait until you bleed out\n\n\nThis isn't call of duty, this is real life. Hollow points are insane, and should not be used.  Do you lack empathy? Why wouldn't you give the same quick, clean death to an animal to a human being?\n\nMy uncle has been attacked by bears and packs wolfs before, always a quick clean round to the ribcage to scare them off, and then waiting for the rest to get the point. \n\nWhy would you deliberately choose a slow form of death over a quick and clean one, if you ruin your wall?

I'm not a cheapskate, a smile when bringing the menu is good enough for me to leave a tip, but if the waiter just brings me what I ordered, I consider that he's done the bare minimum to earn his salary so I don't tip. You mean, as in any business that has to deal with customers?  ( \u0361\u00ba \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00ba) From what I usually see on Internet, the meals you usually get for 15$ are pretty much the same as what I can get here for 15\u20ac. Since we do also tip, they still get an incentive to do a good job here. They just don't get a tip no matter what because it's the rule, only if they work well. You still can tip the waiter abroad.

It was quite convincing.    \nI was about to reply, but I assumed we'd just go in circles, so I left it.  I know, man. So was mine.  Na, there were like 20 comments when I posted this.    \nAlthough, even with just 20~, I could see it turning sour.  If there's one golden rule of reddit.

He also can open all the cupboards and the fridge to look for food, every single door in the house (we always deadbolt the front door so he won't let himself out), he'll flush the toilet to watch the water spin and the best is his penchant for showering.

The wet paw prints everywhere annoy me way more.  Aww poor guy. Clumsy dogs always crack me up, so well meaning.  Mine is half Staffordshire, half lab so he's the exact same way. Short, strong and thick.  Oh man, he sounds like he's a lot of fun though.

Aren't most places at least an hour away with the traffic? Look up Natasha Nice then. Alright offense, time to come alive. WTF are you doing out there? Murray needs to stay in on pass plays. Subbing out constantly like that is letting Detroit tee off on Romo every time he goes to pass. What the FUCK refs? He gets blocked into a player and you call it on us? Fuck every one of you. To the same guy it was called on too. I'm glad, if that was anything it should have been a block in the back. That's a first. Going to prevent here was a mistake. Agreed. Need to adjust to their pass rush for the second half, but we're still in this. You've got a car driving at you and you're less than 2 feet away from a cement pillar. The choice seems obvious, Henry. It's just that kind of game. FUCK YES MURRAY! We've still got a shot. But does he die at the beginning or the end? The lead is a great actor, but we'll have to see if he can make it watchable. Favorable spot, should have been 3rd and 3. Just calling it as I saw it. Flair up. C.J. Spillman has been a great pickup. Almost Anthony rides again. WAY TO MISS THE FACEMASK REFS!\n\nEDIT: Wait a second...nice. I'm pretty sure Witten was 'wiley' as a rookie. Doesn't get any clearer than that hold. The Romo-Smith bromance is real. That was still the right call. He couldn't turn around because his facemask was being grabbed. This game is a trainwreck. GG Detroit. You scary, but our defense earned that one on the last drive. Go away stupid sexy Rodgers, this year is our turn!\n\nLets go Cowboys! **W** **L** **A** She doesn't have the vocal range. Not sure about that, but there was a nice hold right by him just before he threw it. No excuses today though, we win or go home. I'll have you know that we root for the Spurs in the Lone Star State. Good job refs, the next check is in the mail in 5 minutes. Sure, there have been ticky tack calls both ways so far. So just how disappointed is the NFL that the weather isn't worse with all of their Ice Bowl II hype? That ref has a nice arm. That's our defense! *sniff* \"Julius Thomas to the Pro Bowl, huh? Watch this.\" Williams :( Need a closer look on that one...\n\nEDIT: I don't see that as a catch. Maybe not enough to overturn, but that ball turned and the nose would have hit the ground there. At least somebody outside of the fanbase gets it. Terrible call not overturning that. It costs them nothing, so yes. Then they either didn't have the angle from behind or they're as blind as bats. It shouldn't work like that. If there is an angle where it's clearly, indisputably incomplete then that should take precedent over the worse angle. You don't let someone off of an assault charge because one angle doesn't show them swinging. It turned against the ground with either hand of the receiver on a side and BOUNCED.\n\nIt doesn't get clearer than that. Not too happy about a couple of things this game, but it's still close. It's the second half and we have the ball: lets do this. Not seeing a tip on the initial angle. If it's there it's so slight that it didn't seem to affect the initial trajectory. It was if he wasn't prevented from coming back on his route. You can challenge PI if you think the ball was tipped.

A 110lbs woman can defend herself form a 200+lb man. if citizens decide it is time to overthrow the Government, there is not much they could do to stop us. It up to people to store items that can be used for violence locked up and secured. Just like a car.  And to be fair, I like my penis this way. Really? We have welfare, medicaid, food stamps, and tons of programs to help poor people. Hell people get like 2500$ minimum per year just for having one child. And it goes up to like 8K for having two kids, even if you did not work. We also have section 8 housing for poor people and many homeless shelters and we have the most non-profit companies int he world. Here is the difference in America, you actually have to do a little bit of leg work to get all these benefits, and many just give up or don't care.  Only one State has a Pennant, name it.... Ruba dub dub, thanks for the grub.  So really what would happen if Ohio turned on it's own Government? We have 1 major military instalation that is Wright Patterson Airforce base, how long do you think it would stand with 15 million gun owners? And to stop us you would have to start bombing your own cities, most military members would not do that.  It's not a democracy it is a Republic. Ultimately who ever is appointed to the Electoral College can vote however they want, thus an invisible group of people elect our Presidents and Vice President. The names are never made public, so we have no idea who is picking our Presidents and Vice Presidents. Nope, it's round on the sides and high in the middle.  Yeah, and where are they? Not in most states.  It's OHIO I opened a bank account with the bank in that movie just to get a 870 Wingmaster 12ga for free.  But the term militia means every able bodied man, so what is your point.  I thought that was the day after Christmas where you box up nice things and give them to the poor?  Guns just fire bullets, they have no brain and cannot move on their own. And just to prove you point, my 45 has been in the same place for the past 10 days and has not made a peep. That mother was at fault because she did not secure her weapon. If she is going to carry you carry on your person and not in your purse. She is dead because she choose fashion over her responsibility to carry a gun correctly.  Oh yeah, I had to get the hell out. Was gone at 17.  Yep, that is correct!  I never understood this either. We want both!!!! The event that Americans commonly call the \"First Thanksgiving\" was celebrated by the Pilgrims after their first harvest in the New World in 1621.[3] This feast lasted three days, and it was attended by 90 Native Americans (as accounted by attendee Edward Winslow)[4] and 53 Pilgrims.[5] The New England colonists were accustomed to regularly celebrating \"thanksgivings\"\u2014days of prayer thanking God for blessings such as military victory or the end of a drought.[6] Hey I voted for Ross Perot back in 1994, at least some us wanted a change and he was our last best hope.   That is why they have these things called jobs. If you are not physically able to preform any job, you can get disability and possibly Social Security.   The first legislation on the subject was The Militia Act of 1792 which provided, in part:\n\n\"That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, ... every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock.... \"\n\n*Edit and here is the modern explanation:\n\n21st Century: Federally organized or not\n\nIn the 2008 decision of the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, the de jure definition of \"militia\" as used in United States jurisprudence was discussed. The court's opinion made explicit, in its obiter dicta, that the term \"militia\", as used in colonial times in this originalist decision, included both the federally organized militia and the citizen-organized militias of the several States: \"... the 'militia' in colonial America consisted of a subset of 'the people'\u2014those who were male, able-bodied, and within a certain age range\" (7) ... Although the militia consists of all able-bodied men, the federally organized militia may consist of a subset of them\"(23).[76] They did a great job in Kent State, I know all about that one.  It's illegal for the military to put boots on the ground in the US, and goes against the Constitution and then all military members involved would be considered enemy combatants. How many military members do you think would turn their guns on their fellow citizens?   Machine gun means automatic fire, semi-auto means it fires one bullet at a time without recocking the gun. Almost no Americans own fully automatic weapons, they are extremely expensive and pretty damn rare.  Blame Bill Clinton for signing that great trade Deal with China and signing NAFTA into law.  I know who almost all politicians are, and I will not be voting for him.  I fear you do not realize the resentment many active service members have against sitting politicians. I would say that they would have at least a 40% defection rate if they ever tried to do anything on American soil, soldiers are not dumb and certainly know what their oath consists of.   I use mine to kill deer, rabbits, coons, skunks, sick dogs, win money, and generally have a good time.  They are not allowed to do that, and almost every soldier knows that.  OK, send a plane to Cleveland in minutes. Clock starts now.  And the federal Government has done little to suppress them.   If you really like flags, head on over to /r/vexillology ! The study of flags!  So it was 92, years get lost.  I agree with that.  That is not what I meant, I meant most soldiers are outside of the US Well dicks are hard like 1% of their life. Even that is stretching it (pardon the pun) (24 minutes of erections a day is possible but not normal) and circumcision are also done to keep little boys clean down there. you can't pretend everyone is 100% hygienic in this country. I have a great idea for that. Free Gun safes for anyone that wants one. Do a tax credits just like we did with cash for clunkers. It would lower accidental deaths and gun theft by about 70%, but gun owners don't like that idea because it could be used to create a national database of gun owners and liberals don't like it because it would be a tax break to those they hate the most.  I do like cleaning them, it is relaxing. And guns hold their value better than almost anything I can think of. Hell sometimes you can sell it for a lot more later on if it was a special run.  You are certainly free to have that opinion, but my Constitution says otherwise.  For the most part yes. I have never been without a job more than a few days. Since I was 14, I am 40 now. It might be a job you don't like, but there are jobs out there.   Because you never aim to maim, you aim for center mass and this lowers the likely hood of hitting something behind your target. You always shoot to kill.  I am American so I was just making my best guess.  /r/reloading can help you with that.  And I never had any problems with it, seems to work fine. Now forcing it on 13 year old kids like the Jews do, that is wrong, at that point they should be able to decide. Everyone that was not Jewish had this done in the era that I was born.  Good thing the Supreme Court clarified this for us. *See [District of Columbia Vs Heller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) and if you are too lazy to visit that page. \n\n\"District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held in a 5-4 decision that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution applies to federal enclaves and protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. The decision did not address the question of whether the Second Amendment extends beyond federal enclaves to the states,[1] which was addressed later by McDonald v. Chicago (2010). It was the first Supreme Court case to decide whether the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.[2]\" Very much like one.  Driving is a privilege and not a right.  Tell that to all the victims I see in /r/dgu everyday.  Well it is also a right that has been upheld by SCOTUS. [DC vs Heller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) so it is not just me. I can own as many as I want. I can own as much ammunition as I want. I bet you did not shoot anything fun, sounds like you went with the wrong guys. Ever shoot some Tannerite? now that is fun.  Well it is also our constitutional right and it was upheld by the SCOTUS in [DC vs Heller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller) Show up at the time of work everyday (early) and ask the manager for a job every single day. I guarantee you will have a job in under 15 days if they are hiring and sometimes even if they are not.   What tax money is spent on guns for private citizens? NICS makes money off of checking backgrounds (20$ per sale). If anything the government makes money off of guns owners. Imagine your outrage at having to pay for the poll workers at your local polling station in order for you to vote. How can a guaranteed right take money away from me and give it to the Government? \n\nEducation is a whole different problem. So is Health Care. Firstly we have some for the best educational institutions in the world and some of the best health care facilities in the world. \n\nWe spend more per capita than any nation on Earth for health care and Education. Money is not the problem, what is the problem? these are all complex issues except the issue of guns. It is a guaranteed right to be able to own modern firearms and use them for self defense. Law professors and Judges nationwide studied the issue and determined that we do have the \"RIGHT\" (not privilege) to own them and keep them. Just like it is your right to speak freely.  \"I just want them to be true to what they said on paper\" - Martin Luther King So what tax dollars are being spent so that Americans can own guns? Nothing, they make money if anything. 20$ per sale to the NICS background check system.  Just like any skill you have varying levels of competition. I play for money, and thankfully have never had to play for blood. We have Turkey Shoots (they are targets not Turkeys), Clay Pigeon Matches, Long Range Matches (went to Camp Perry last year and it was a blast!!), and there are many events. It is much like any sport. \n\nHunting is a fairly large part of the gun culture. We killed all the predators here in the US and really are not going to let them repopulate. you may not understand wolves and bears very well but they would become a huge problem. It's not people like me that will complain but people that have their dogs and cats eaten. There are a lot of animals here. Hunting is very important. \n\nHome defense is also really important and people feel that is right they should have is to protect their home with force if needs be. There is plenty of training available and vast resources to learn the best techniques. Visit /r/DGU (defensive gun use) and see why some of these people would have not survived without the aid of their firearm. How many rapes, child abductions, murders, robberies, has owning a fire arm stopped?   Maybe we should all fix \"Boxing Day\" and turn it back into what it should be. You box up nice stuff and give it to the poor.  I'll fist fight any man before I would get in a gun fight with him. It is for a last defense. What about the 60 year old woman that just had a hip replacement? How brave can she be? Think she is gonna fight off even a 95lb kid?  Yes I do, I can still smell the powder in my nose from shooting this morning. Taking the 30-30 out to 150 yards with open sights.  Because one right is built on another, and without that fundamental building block, it won't hold up over time.  I believe it is Brazil.  That is why I suggested free gun safes to everyone that wants one. 2 per household. It would reduce accidental shootings and stolen firearms by as much as 70%. yet neither side will give into the idea. Gun owners think it will create a database of owners and those against it thinks it gives something free to a person that should just do it on their own. \n\nMaybe add in some free classes they can attend that lets you use free ammo in exchange for a safety course. you can't force people to do anything with a right, it is something you can just do. Best we can do now is suggest and maybe even use tax dollars to help defeat this problem.  I agree with the peaceful protest part, we could literally walk in and take over, if enough people cared. I like people that think like you. guns have their place and there are very few people that seek out a gun that does not want to be proficient with one. I take personal pride on my ability to shoot, but if you were coming at me? I would hit you in the chest every time. To get your CCW (carrying a concealed weapon) here you have to take a course and they train you how to do this. People should have the right to arm themselves. I can just open carry with nothing, which means it is visible to he naked eye and need no training. But trust me everyone notices and watches you if you open carry. And if you are on the sauce, don't be a gun owner.   I never said we had the best, I said we spent the most. Top End we do very well, but overall we spend the most and get terrible results.  Well that is why you do not understand how rights work. They do not bend. They do not give. Try to change it, go ahead, but you will not succeed. What new guns laws have the federal government passed since the 80's?  If a person is running at you, you may not have a choice at the background. So hit the chest.  Tell this to people before they get into radio communications, that shit gets expensive really fast.  In the end it is a tool and as horrible is the thought of killing a person, if someone is trying to get in and has a weapon, you should be able to defend yourself and your home. It's not for everyone, but that option should be open to anyone. I have never pulled my gun, and I hope I never have to. I also hope I never have to use Life Insurance, but there is a good probability that it will happen. I live in East Cleveland, I need them. If you don't need one, stop being a dick to those that do.  At first I thought that was gonna suck, but thanks. I have had a ton of comments today. I do really like guns. They extraordinary little machines.  No, I thank you for your service, but our country has determined that people do have the right to own modern weapons to protect themselves.  Many lawyers and professors that took 4 years to figure this out and the results were defined in the DC vs Heller case.   I am sorry, had too many beers, I actually liked talking to you.   Yeah, shotgun powder is the best smelling powder. Nothing wakes you up like that smell!! Do you do pigeons across the ground at all? That shit is hard as fuck. Did good and got 3/5 on the fast ground targets. Still, I barely got those.   I wont, I am here to protect the weak, those that are afraid to stand up for themselves. I will watch my language in the future. I'd buy you a beer.  I have said this once or twice in this thread, but I will say it again. What about give free gun safes to anyone that wants one? Yes you may have to do it through tax credits but it would make the country safer with each safe installed. Lower theft rates and accidental shooting rates. Maybe up to 70%. If you give people something really nice they tend to use it. Maybe a 1000$ credit per 5 years and it shows up as nothing more than a home credit.  I do, but I talk very well and usually have no problems fitting in everywhere. I usually do not carry my gun. I carry my gun while doing business, lots of cash between truck drivers and the office. Some of them have been on the road for months. They are nuts.  I think it is a good idea. i would also certainly stimulate the talk about gun safety in our country. I took my shotgun to school with me many days, I was in Skeet Shooting and needed it. Schools can teach this stuff. Earlier the better. Just like sex ed.  I have many of them as well. Not great with the sword but I am no slouch with the bow.  Maybe the ones that show bad behavior would show themselves. Teaching is very important. Observations is just as meaningful. We had archery and skeet shooting in HS. We had fun and everyone was safe.  Why do you write things on the internet?.....Because you can....  Nope, It was a public school. We also happen to have a world renowned skeet shooting place about 10 miles from the school. So maybe that had something to do with it. Either way we went on a fishing trip too.  I really liked HS, Freshman year kinda sucked, but after that it was a blast.  My Anaconda don't want none if your ain't Ohio son!  Really so a squadron would not question bombing Cleveland? I have more respect for my pilots than that. What if you had a sister there, or a friend? Would you pull the trigger?  If the Government kills one young White girl on video, it is on like Donkey Kong.  I am pretty sure we wont be friends. Sorry about that.  Handful? If you kill innocent Americans, people will revolt. Not one in the national spotlight is completely innocent.   I guess it is a matter of certain freedoms. WE have them, and we have to deal with the consequence of life decisions if we abuse them.  Answer me one question . Who is in the electoral college?  It's a lot more fun when I am plowing yours!!!  Nope I cannot find that post over there. The person that gave a child that small a loaded gun is the one that deserves the blame.

If Baltimore doesn't go for it, isn't it a total waste of a timeout? If Baltimore doesn't go for it, isn't it a total waste of a timeout? Pass interference and still the bomb is a completion. Why isn't someone assigned to watch a swing pass? Chiefs game? At least the refs can't be accused of rigging the game for the Patriots now ... One play away from bogging down just short of field goal range again. Finally the Patriots just take a positive yardage play on first down down near field goal range. The strange thing is the Patriots left points off the scoreboard by not doing more of this dink and dunk near field goal range earlier in the game. Ravens can dink and dunk today as well. Patriots already blitzed once Patriots already blitzed once.  Do they have another blitz that can bring pressure? Both teams taking timeouts like this 4th down is the ballgame.  And it very well might be. Ravens I think will roll Flacco out. Brilliant call with the spread formation.  The Patriots with a 4 man pass rush even against just 5 offensive linemen just can't get there against the Ravens. The Patriots have never replaced Willie McGinest, and that's a huge problem with the defense they run. Flacco will have a chance for one miracle bomb.  Not like that's ever worked, right, other than versus Denver ...\n\nObviously it would take perhaps the most miraculous play in NFL playoff history for New England to lose this. This is 2015 and there is still a place for stick figures in graphics ... Have they mentioned yet the immortal playoff game where the Cowboys beat the Lions 5 - 0?  Check out these passing stats from that game:\n\nhttp://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197012260dal.htm\n\nFor example, Craig Morton, the quarterback for the winning team, completed 4 - 18 for 38 yards and one interception. Fox did interview some quarterback Stafford who played high school football in Texas ... I don't know if it was intentional or not but with the charcoal gray suits, what stands out is Aikman's watch.  When will the smart watch companies start paying for that visual ... They should change the name of NFL kickoffs to kickouts. Have to run the football on wide nine. This whole week of football, college and pros, fielding punts has been an adventure. Cowboys gash wide nine again with the run. Good idea to run away from Suh. So they don't plan to get a much cheaper actor than Liam Neeson and have something like Taken vs Hostel vs Saw? \"No foul on the play for an offensive pass interference.\" Suh was a manimal that sack. Suh showed those last two plays the definition of having a motor. Fuller brushed off the coverage. What are the rules about face guarding in the NFL? Dallas's offense should be:  run away from Suh and don't get sacked by Suh. Did anyone think the football wasn't going to Witten ... Williams makes up for his false start. Totally inexcusable to not just fall on the football there.  That could cost the Cowboys the season. He got a practice kick at a cost of 5 yards. He got a practice kick at a cost of 5 yards.  And he missed it the same way. So coaches have learned to not give practice kicks by taking timeouts late? It's amazing how close 3rd and 1 runs are in any era of football. I think Green Bay leaving extra blockers in to protect Rodgers will bog down their offense sooner or later.  Leaving 7 in for example means everyone going out for a pass can be double covered or at least always has a safety for help.\n\nAt some point I think Green Bay will have to go back to having all 5 eligible receivers go out and hope for the best.  It's the best shot for a big play. I don't see any conclusive evidence of a tip? Was that a classic Packer sweep with pulling guards on 1st down? How are the refs going to sort this one out ... I agree with that play:  On an obvious passing down just go spread and hope for the best. Like I said, paradoxically to protect Rodgers the Packers had to go spread and send everyone out for a pass. Have they got to a Raiders o-lineman catching a pass and then being blasted into fumbling? Crowd's there now.  Why not, this could be a historic day for the Panther franchise. Once it touches a Cardinal a Panther can pick up the ball at no risk. Nothing like having an NFL kicker who can hit 47 yard field goals.  A huge difference from college ball. The same as Sy Fy showing the movie Braveheart? Run a QB draw. The happiest person watching the past few Panthers games is Cam Newton's agent, because a $100+ million contract is headed their way in the offseason? Ron Rivera and Carolina shows if you are a first-time head coach and if the talent on your team matures by your third year as head coach, you still have a job, and if they don't, you probably won't have one. The only thing that could get Arizona back into the game. Do the Cardinals even have a fade to Larry Fitz? Wait a second.  Are you telling me in the most important series of the year the Cardinals can't find a spot on the field for Larry Fitz?! Throw the fade. Duh they finally find Larry Fitz.  Who else?

The constitution says state militias have the right to bear arms... The NRA likes to misinform the population. The Supreme Court rules in favor of the social norms. For example In Plessy, separate but equal was constitutional, but 50 years later, in Brown, they over turned that decision. So really, it the public misrepresenting the Courts and what the Constitution actually states. You are missing the context. First off all, in 1786 militias were heavily prevalent, especially in light of the Revolutions, and its predecessor the Articles of Confederation. Militias were armies that were stated owned, because the latter form of law pretty much disallowed a central form of government. \n\nSecondly, again, the wording of the Constitution is STATE-OWNED. Organizations such as the National Guard, which are first upheld through state legislations, is more what this amendment speaks about. Individual men are not militias. Individual men are not state-owned.  Would you look at that... Hmm... Nowhere does it say individual people. \n\n&gt; \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nHere is the link. \n\nhttp://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment\n\nEnjoy.  That is regulated. In historical context, that was considered state-owned.\n\nEdit: Even the people of that age agree on that historical context\n\n&gt;Sir William Blackstone described this right as an auxiliary right, the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state.\n\nHere is the link\n\n http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution Except those ideals do not exist for me.

That was heart attack worthy. FUCK GOLDEN TATE No. Beasley gonna sell your mom some pot after he gets those third downs. What is that? A quarter of a yard line? What a load of shit. What a bunch of shit tackling. Not like it matters. We can't get pressure for shit against anyone. I need more liquor for this game. Cowboys need to get their shit together. This unit that has looked incredible most of the season is playing like last years unit. McClain looks fucking mad. Still plenty of time for that. That is McClain.

Witten the Magician is his name for a reason liver cirrhosis Nice play on Carr for fucking once in his lifetime **Let's go Murray** What was that fucking throw? Jesus fucking Christ. He was open on that pass to Witten. Ten yards plus between him and any defenders, 10 yards out of the endzone. You honestly don't see more than one of those a game, unless it's really really bad. If we got called for fucking running into the kicker with barely touching him, how isn't the penalty called for running into the receiver on a fair catch? Yeah. I saw this shitty officiating coming from the beginning of the game when they mentioned how inexperienced the refs were. Oh well. He is my favorite fighter behind Rousey. get out Romo's back is obviously bothering him. A lot of these passes have been short or inaccurate. ...OPI? Are you joking? **WILLIAMS FUCK YEAH FUCK YOUR SHIT OPI YOU FUCKING SHIT REFS** Yes, because we all know it's illogical to celebrate being within one score. You're a fucking moron. You shouldn't even watch football because you clearly know nothing about it. How about instead of talking shit, you fucking enjoy the game? That's how Chicago 'came back' against us. It's really terrible defensive playcalling. FUCK YOU DETROIT I'm so sick of seeing fucking fair weather Cowboys fans on Reddit. Everyone is declaring that this game is over after we've had come backs while being deeper in the hole this season. Get the fuck out of here, find a different team to root for if you have no faith. It's only thirteen fucking points. I said this earlier and ended up with 10 downvotes. Dallas 'fans' have been saying the same shit. Reddit fans make me fucking sick sometimes. It sickens me. Most of my adult life, the Cowboys have been absolute trash, and I see all these fucking assholes who have no faith and quit early every game that we're down. It's like looking at these people in the VIP boxes and corrals at the stadium who make no noise. It's pathetic. \"The Lions aren't dirty.\" lol How are you going to turn your head when someone's hand is around your fucking head? He absolutely went high. He made no effort to hit his chest at all. He lowered his shoulder towards his head and even threw a forearm in there. Liar. Kind of like that running into the kicker that was called on us which was fucking ridiculous, and the one where our punter was full on tacked and wasn't called. So if no one noticed on that withdrawn DPI, the receiver was first holding the facemask, then grabbed the side of the defender's head. There was no opportunity for him to turn his head. **WITTEN THE MAGICIAN** I've been angry all game, and drunk, and this made me laugh. It's been a great game, man. Best this weekend by far. lol shut up **TOUCHDOWN WILLIAMS** **FUCK ALL THE FAIRWEATHER DALLAS FANS WHO SAID THIS WAS OVER. I REPEAT: FUCK ALL YOU FAIRWEATHER MOTHERFUCKERS** There have been questionable calls here, like every game. The DPI penalty that was picked up was probably the result of the defender having his facemask held, then having his helmet grabbed. They missed a running into the kicker on the Lions that was almost a blatant tackle. It hasn't been great officiating, but it's been a tense game. Watch the replay. It was a clear facemask on the receiver, the receiver then held onto the defender's head in the process of the catch. It's also not the first questionable call here. What about us at the 40+, our punter getting full on tackled, and no call? **FUCK YES** Shut up. It wasn't the only questionable call. You salty cunt. Did anyone else hear Bradshaw on Aaron Rodgers?\n\n&gt; I question Aaron's Rodgers. I have a career, but outside that I'm right there with you, man. Girlfriend of three years told me things are pretty much over this morning, I'm sick, my cat died, and life sucks.\n\n**Go Cowboys** **THIS IS NOT GREEK YOGURT. THIS WILL NEVER BE KALE. IT WILL NEVER BE DECONSTRUCTED OR INFUSED.** I'll be tired of it being an excuse for the loss. Here's to a great game of fuck you. Choo choo, motherfucker. Yeah, because the Seahawks are not familiar to failure. I think they got enough good news this morning to stick with their team. Aren't Beats by Dre the best? I heard they are really good quality and a great price! /s Ice Cream Bowl As a Cowboys fan, I've heard this so many times this year. Every single time we play a decent defense, and now this. ...give himself what? Well, you simply have to know when to hold them. Wait for halftime! Jesus. My heart. Because the players are just trying to get off that shitty fucking turf. I would have like to see a replay of that too, but all it takes is a small portion of the body to be behind the line. It's a fucking stupid rule. I really wish we'd get creative with the offensive playcalling. Better than Eagles fans? Beautiful. :*l I love how the edited the least meaningful bit of that song. It's Linehan. Pretty much run, run, pass. Clutts is clutch. Fuck Brandon Carr. I fucking hate him so much. I tried to justify his shit play. But it's just that, shit play. Oh? With the no flag on Matthews? Huh. It's almost like they are human and fuck up. It is literally triple the temperature of the Ice Bowl. Shut the fuck up about it **MINCEY THE MONSTER** JESUS. I UNDERSTAND. MY POINT WAS THAT IT'S MUCH WARMER AND NOT -48 WINDCHILL.  Williams is really starting to mature and it makes me hard. Dez, Witten, Williams, Beasley? Yes fucking please. I hate him for fucking Olivia Munn. We're coming for you after we get done with the Seahawks. It's good. Out of the screeners that have come out, I'd say The Imitation game might be the best one. Fury was also excellent. Inherent Vice is really good. Unbroken is decent. Romo laughing at the spot. &lt;3 Witten the Magician! **ITT:** Anything positive about the Cowboys gets downvoted. ITT: The Packers are one and done again.\n\nBut really, it's not the points, it's the petulant attitudes. That was the point. *The Law* get his man. He puts on a really good show. He's an exciting fighter to watch, too. \"Calling it the Ice Bowl II. We can do it if we want to, I guess.\" Joe Buck, professional sports announcer. Damn, for a guy that seems so docile, Lacy really fucking fights for yards. That is close, but it doesn't look like it makes contact with Peppers. Just barely goes by his hand. That wasn't tipped. Close, but not tipped. **Fuck.** **SALT CHIPS** I think as long as Murray kept Lacy at range and stuffed the takedowns, he could pull out the win. But he'd have to watch out for a lights out punch from Lacy. To everyone saying it's bullshit, it's really not. The play was over and Lang made a hit afterwards.\n\n**Edit:** The go after the instigator. Stop being fucking denialists. Where they put the good FX comedy now. /r/nflstreams **Ch-ch-chippy.** We can be friends until the Vikings are good again. http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2s36ec/second_half_game_thread_dallas_cowboys_124_at/ **CHEERS PLAYOFF BROTHERS, MAY YOU ALL FAIL HORRIBLY** Guys, it's a quarterback driven offense, if you didn't know.

It's not just a couple of isolated incidents. It's rampant.  So much horse shit in a single post. Where did you find it all? I'm 100% certain that it doesn't matter which mythology he does or doesn't believe in. Just because a historical figure used a mythology to manipulate the masses doesn't make that mythology true. It means that that leader was effective at using that mythology as a tool. Hitler, who (despite whatever else he was) was a very charismatic leader, invoked god and divine providence as the basis of the Third Reich and murdered millions.  \n\nI have read plenty of books. Many of them don't even have pictures. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that no matter what faith you claim or don't claim. Not a single person alive knows for certain what happens after death. Each religion has some notion of what happens but so far none have provided any quantifiable evidence that theirs is the correct assumption. To claim that faith as a basis for leadership is simply absurd.  That's funny, I think it's pretty naive that you don't think leaders use religion a a tool for manipulation considering how rampant it is throughout history.

That penis was *mutilated* and you just want to pull on it? You'll just cause more damage on top of the irreparable harm that guys scumbag parents already caused /s Of course, I'm not condoning it at all. I'm just a bit annoyed that it's something people associate with America when there are other countries which are much more extreme about it. It's basically the same as one of the main arguments against communism. If people are going to get paid no matter what they have no incentive to put their best effort in. They'll work hard if they know it will get them more money A large part of George Washington's farewell address as he left office warned that a two party system would fuck up the country, but we didn't listen. Eight different states do, you can find them [here](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_qualifications_for_public_office_in_the_United_States). It is unconstitutional, but since it isn't enforced the Supreme Court can't do anything about it Some of it's good though, for eight of them the requirement is that you can't be a member of the clergy I'm a high school student right now. Most people in my homeroom think that it's cultish and weird. You're looked down on more for saying it than for not saying it. I guess it probably depends on what part of the country you're in though Yes, I'm not condoning it, I'm just saying that it's not strictly American. I'd rather be an atheist in America that pretty much every country on the list.\n\nBtw, did you read the article? America *isn't* on there, because it's unconstitutional. Yep, that certainly doesn't help, especially when other employees income is based on the tip pooling, not just the waiters What question? \"Circumcision.\" Isn't a question. Democracy is a bitch when most people disagree with you Oh, whoosh, I missed that If you read the article you would have realized that the US isn't on the list for the reasons you provided And I was replying to a comment which said that if a politician wants to be successful they need to be religious, which absolutely *is* and American thing, it's just a social construct rather than a legal one. I meant that I like tipping in general, instead of the waiters just earning a set amount of money Are you on mobile?

The mere sound of me cocking an unloaded .45 at my back door stopped a break-in attempt, and saved the local police from possibly having to tell my family I'd been raped/murdered. You don't always have to fire the weapon to prevent crime. There has never been another attempt on my property. It's not about killing someone to protect your home or possessions, or even about killing anyone (although you never shoot to maim). It's about giving yourself every possible advantage in the event that someone wants to kill YOU. You never shoot someone just to protect your 'stuff'. Guns are only to be used if there is a direct threat to your life. \n\nAs to the medieval aspect, I respect your opinion, of course. When I think of 'medieval', I think of a time when the only people allowed to own weapons were the landed gentry. I like the idea that in the USA, every citizen, regardless of class or status, is empowered to defend him or herself in a life-threatening situation.  \n\nThat said, I was raised here. My family has always owned firearms, and I was taught to see them as a tool, more than something to fear. I learned to use, clean, and respect them at a young age. I might have a totally different opinion if I grew up outside the US. I think it's just a cultural difference, and one I'm happy to accept.  I stayed with a host family in Southern France for a month to work on my fluency, and I loved it. Honestly, if I lived there, I probably wouldn't feel the need for anything more than a hunting rifle (where allowed), either. It is a different place, with a different culture that I respect and admire just as much as my own.  \n\nThe US has it's own culture like every other nation, and like every other nation, we do weird things that seem gauche to the world community. The right (but not compulsion) to own firearms is written into our founding documents, and I accept that it may look messed up if you weren't born into it. Cultural perspectives are so different from one nation to the next, and I'm glad we all have different flavors of weird; it keeps life interesting.\n\nAlso, I actually do live in a terrible neighborhood, and I hear gunfire on a regular basis. Despite all that, I have never shot, or even aimed my weapon at an actual human. With the exception of the time I scared off an intruder with an unloaded .45, all of my gun experiences involve spending quality time with my dad, grandpa, and later, my husband and brothers-in-law at the shooting range.

Bears fans apparently don't understand the difference between past and future. 20 bucks to sit on a pillow full of other people's beer farts?  I'd have to think that over. Clearly, the Ice Bowl was far superior to this. No Joe Buck. What about the flag that came in during the pile? His spirit animal is animatronic Now I know why so many teams passed over him in the draft: insubordinate and churlish. True.  Of course, he didn't. Mhe just had his hand there which is (suuposed to be) fine if youmdon't alter the receiver's course.  That call was pure bullshit, especially after the arm grab was not called. There shouldn't have been a ball to drop.  A legit PI - uncalled - should have extended the ARI drive. CAR should not have had the ball to score and be kicking off. He's better than we realize at holding back water? Even funnier when you consider that he's not personally involved in most of the problematic calls. Did Joe Montana get divorced, or develop a gambling problem, or something? He seems to have decided he needs a ton of cash *now*. STBY, birdbros.

Head over and have a look at the legs of guys in their mid 20s. Don't forget the mini fluro shorts and half sleave tattoos.  I'm actually from the west and most of the guys here in their mid 20s have shaved or trimmed legs.  Haha same here. Getting myself to trim my facial hair is a challenge.  Hope the trend stops here soon as well, mate.  Mid 20s is where it's more concentrated but I have noticed that even some 18 year olds start trimming or shaving.  Same here. I trim my upper body but never touch my arms or legs.  We have a few people that do this as well. Mostly guys with tattoos.  Mate, Sydney has been getting softer and softer as time goes by.

If anyone it'll be Wilson ;D ow right in the transverse process We won't know until the Dallas/Detroit game Illinois' is selling Goose Island to Anheuser-Busch.\n\nYou animals. OH FUCK OFF WITH THAT FLAG I think it's time we put Hochuli in a home. It's for the best. Lindley better channel his inner GOAT or commit seppuku on the 50 yard line. I hope this physically hurts Kurt Warner to watch. Deep in his soul.\n\nLook at what you fucking did. No. Pay-to-win garbage. I love a good old Hochuli explanation. \"Heh I thought you meant we were gonna be givin' away $5 footlongs, Mike!\" You'd be killed by an angry mob of mostly white people pls be a turnover\n\nplease please please THAT'S A FUMBLE ALL DAY BABY!

Lindley is starting. \nOK Cardinals' offensive gameplan is to throw it deep and pray for a flag.  The toilet bowl of the postseason begins now.  Good field position for Cam.  Benjamin is just using Will-O-Wisp on Pat Pete right now.  Panthers strike first. \nYour move Lindley.  EVERY FUCKING CHANNEL WITH THE SMOKEY COMMERCIALS I'M FUCKING DONE GO FOR IT GG\nno way Lindley scores twice.  8:30 they just did MUFFED PUNT This game is far from ogre.  Arizona run game weak.  Fitz was wide open What was that Mcdonalds commercial? I'd die happily of an erection that lasted more than 4 hours.  Rly I think he'd look great in Purple and Black inb4saftey Cards fans has your punter always been this bad? ah that explains it It's Cam. Unlike most QBs Cam has some legs on him That's the right call This worries me for the national championship ball was knocked out and Cam's arm smacked it foward. thats a fumble WHOSE READY FOR RAVENS/STEELERS And thats game.

So does just mentioning Taylor Swift just get you gold? Is Rodgers gonna pull a Schilling today? That was incidental contact Rodgers looking very unRodgers on that play I was referring to how he should have thrown the ball when defenders were converging on him That kicker... A bunch of guys who are only there for the food? It seems like Rodgers gets sacked at the most inopportune times I simulated this game using Madden '09 for the Wii. Matt Leinart was the MVP of the game with 187 passing yards and two touchdowns. [Cardinals win 25-21](http://i.imgur.com/iuwHfgl.png) How did 4 out of 5 ESPN commentators pick the 7-8-1 Panthers? But it's Saturday Sadly, no Coming out strong. I like it. Holy shit, grab it! Why isn't there a Panthers logo at midfield? I think they have to have a certain amount of commercials per game. They fill them in before the half, so there can be uninterrupted play when it comes to crunchtime. Didn't play. Just let the AIs go at it and watched. Questionable call?\n\nEDIT: Nevermind.

Here's my impression of ESPN every time Newton makes a bad throw.\n\n\"LOLOL XD WHEN DID THEY SIGN BRANDON WEEDEN LOL\" And only because of a fumble When Newton pushes him out of bounds, does he get credit for the tackle? Why wasn't there a flag for Fitzgerald getting into a wrestling match? lolcards Might want to challenge that Every time I see that Agent Carter commercial, I think it's Carmen San Diego Yeah. They need indisputable evidence that he was down. If it's not conclusive, it's a fumble. It would be just like the NFL refs to say the exact opposite of what everyone is thinking. Well, it was overturned, since it was conclusive. Well, if it was called fumble, but then they look at it and can't decide/see if it was a touchdown, it's a fumble. But the question is.... can they score? That was the least climactic hail mary ever Yeah, I mean, we just saw what happened. Why do you need to tell us about it? Is that all the Browns are being remembered for? Not our 7-win season? Getting kicked in the face? Fuck. Don't worry. There will be a new song next year. Still, this is our best season in years.

I know things will turn around. I'm still young. This flu season is fucked though. Why is everyone getting sick? I'm sorry man. Sending some Cowboys love your way! Here's to hoping this Cowboys' win makes us all feel better.  I'd be interested in seeing that. If we lose and that happens maybe Jerry turning to ash will be best for all of us.  In that case I'll let the football gods sacrifice me.  Nah dude. According to her, it's my fault she cheated. I mind controlled her and the dude into fucking. Damn my powers.  I wouldn't say I get sick a lot. But this is my second time going through flu symptoms in the past month. The virus is probably embedded in my house considering I live with 4 other dudes. 1 of which has also been sick.  Thank you for your service! And I'm glad you're getting out. Stay safe for your family.  The best advice I can give is just to let her go buddy. It's what I'm trying to do now. You'll be back to yourself eventually and one day you'll meet another gal. There are others out there for you, and eventually you'll look back on this time as a learning experience.  Well that's not wishing me the best... Lol  Lions cheated themselves. Shoulda played better.  This is the best advice I've been given and I will certainly try to follow it. Everything you said is on point. So thanks for the advice! Hope the Giants go 0-16 next year! No I did not. I never have I don't think. Maybe once when I was a younger. Is that something people should do every year? Sorry to hear that my dude. Just keep trucking along. There is no right way to live life. A win would just make everything better.  Why do some people decide not to get one? Is there anything negative associated with it? Haha yea if I was a Redskins fan, it would be exponentially worse right now. Thanks for the kind words! Ah gotcha. After this year, I will definitely be getting one next year. It's too late now right? I mean this is my second time with the flu in a month.  Anyone can do it! Just wait until we are playing on February 1st... Damn, I really should have gotten one. I won't be making that mistake again. Fuck the flu. It's messed up.  Oh you'll watch it. You'll watch it and you'll like it.  Dafuq Bailey? Hopefully this isn't one of those things where as a kicker you start missing FGs all the time after missing one. Think Vanderjagt.  Yea but still missed the warm up kick before that. Missed last week. Seen too many misses from Bailey lately. Blocked or not.  Interesting how they're favored to win while losing. That doesn't make much sense.  It was a jump ball in the end zone where he landed on his back. It didn't look too bad. Was able to walk off on his own. Probably just got the wind knocked outta him.  Rodgers looks like he's playing hop scotch out there.  Yea of course. But no guarantee they score from it. You would think the winning team would at least be at 51%. Should be a great second half.  Well +3 per half and they are down 4. Still doesn't make sense to me. But I'll accept it.  Is Rodgers dating Olivia Munn? I'm debating with my friend whether Rodgers could potentially be gay. (Serious question).\n\nEdit: damn guys, I don't think he's gay and could care less if he was. Just wondering who he is dating. If he were gay however, I would love it.

I guess it's an opinion shared by older people nowadays, especially parents who were taught that without a college degree, there's no well-paid job awaiting you.

I feel another turnover... Never mind.  Some one rich af. -800 a non QB would throw a TD pass this weekend.  The fourth quarter is going to be sooooooo good.  Lots of time left for Joe Cool.

This should really be the 'bit chilly, but still manageable bowl' The \"turn the car on 10 minutes before you leave to heat it up bowl\" Yeah a lot of our fans are being douchebags. Every fanbase has them unfortunately Too risky imo. They get the ball at half, so if they score, it'd be a huge momentum shift and they'd get the opportunity to score again. Very generous.  That was a generous spot and you fucking know it.  Fuck you dude What in the absolute fuck is wrong with Dan Bailey? He even got a fucking practice kick there.\n\nedit: Guess he got a hand on it. Makes sense. Should the booth be doing a review during timeouts? I thought the challenge flag should be thrown. I asked a question. Take your condescending shit elsewhere.

Fucking NBC man I don't like this intro video very much... HE'S A FUCKING MACHINE! http://www.nbc.com/live or http://stream.nbcsports.com/liveextra/ That's no Tony Romo, I was expecting the MVP.

I'd be wanting to replace them as well.  I'm calling it now, 4th quarter, one bullshit call finally goes against New England but then get's waved off and Ravens fans spend all week talking about conspiracies and sports rigging.  First and goal spot of the foul or denied and caught? Oh shit! Taunting!! 1st and Goal from the 16! Haven't noticed that, will keep an eye out for it now though. How would anyone know how many times they've failed to overcome 12 points though based on 11 being the highest comeback alone? It's a useful stat.  Guys if you think the Pats fans are salty now just wait until later after the Panthers upset the SEChawks!! HAHAHAHAHA!!! Jimmy!!!! Not making fun of, commending. Y'all have the most SEC players as starters, 14, thus the SEChawks.  No, they play the West.  Good for y'all? You got the South next season.  Won 3, lost 3. Has a nice ring to it for sure.  Tie game! Oh shit!! 51 yards!!! 42-28 coming up! Your move Balti! He's a fucking machine y'all!!  INTERCEPTION!! NBC is the worst.  FUMBLE FORWARD!!! First and goal? Chicago Fire is such a great show.

Cowboys look like shit all around, Stafford looks like he's on it today. The moisture? What the fuck Troy. Welp, the Reddit servers are being complete shit today. These refs are completely blowing some of these calls. Lol These refs are making shit calls. Like really shit calls. JINX Channing Tatum looks stupid as fuck in that movie. Commercials would be a lot better if they didn't play the same five ones the entire game. It's in your settings when using alien blue, I forget exactly where but just look through it and you'll find it! Beat them boys. Rodgers honestly looks fine, get off to a hot start, then let Lacy run the clock once the cold sets in. \"Andrew Luck looks like a drifter that robs gas stations\" Kate Upton needs to stop attempting to act. This is the warmest it's been in Wisconsin all week, it's honestly like 40 degrees too the people who live in this weather. It's not cold. All day baby, all day.

There's been three plays \ud83d\ude02 Packers Pathetic.  Rodgers doesn't look like Rodgers today. Good block huh Joe Buck? Thought that was picked SOMEONE GIF ROMO ON THE GROUND his face was hilarious  What kinda spot was that? What the fuck he was a yard short. So there's a sad individual with the username fuck_wisconsin that is sending a PM where he talks about how shitty wisconsin is, I feel as though he is a disgruntled individual. No it's okay, he's not black enough CORN! Absolutely shocked we're still in this with how Rodgers had looked.  Just let Olivia Munn into the locker room and just let her go to work on Rodgers leg. It's just disgusting, like damn hate the team but no need for that kinda stuff. As much as I dislike the rest of the NFC North I wouldn't want something like that to happen. Save it for trash talk and the field, we're all people. I wanna hate Russel Wilson, but I can't since he played for the Badgers. I'd pay to watch that unfold  My prediction:\n\nRodgers comes out with half a gallon of numbing medicine shot into his leg. We've shut Murray down this game so far. What was wrong with Heyward's coverage? It was within five yards so it shouldn't be a flag right? (I know it wasn't called but Troy was saying it could've been called on him too.) Not on Williams that was definitely a flag. FUCK YEA Peppers is going off today EDDIE EDDIE EDDIE! Come on TJ :( Alice in Chains!

Pretty sure it's his high school, Bronxville.  The difference there is that Tate didn't fumble.  We Dem Boyz He did shank it though You can't do that! Um, yes, there is question.  Church unleashed a demon.  Because it's not.  Could make about 100 margaritas with all the salt in here.  Maybe they'll stop whining about the officials now.       Can't get a more blatant hold than that.  What a shitty fucking spot.  King Bailey eh? Everyone thinks their kicker is the most accurate kicker.  Wtf was that play call.  If you can't run the ball more than 1 yard, maybe you should stop running the ball? Get off the fucking field Dez.  WHAT THE FUCK ....lol.  no Quit whining Yes, out of the millions of football fans in the country, you're the only person who likes good offensive lines.  I'll watch Fox News over the garbage CNN and MSNBC dresses up as \"news\" any day of the week.  \"Best kicker in the league\" so we hear every time Bailey attempts a FG.  You do know that \"Faux News\" is pronounced \"Fo News\", so it doesn't even come close to even sounding like that.  People who use that are dumber than the people that they think they're insulting when they chide them for watching it.  Oh wait, so now Cowboys fans decide to whine about the officiating? Yes, the \"best kicker in the league\" missed the FG.  He technically missed twice as the first kick was blown dead due to a false start.  Probably.  Manufactured fake continental fandom tends to irk me.   Did they not learn from last week that mixing officials doesn't work? If Dez whines about it, it will come.  Yes, we know Cowboys fans are.  That's how you strip a football Dallas.  Defense not even once.  Holy shit Throw 2 flags, only call one foul.  NFL playoff ref logic.   All that time and that's the throw he decides to make? 49ers know all about that play :) Who's Matt Dodge?  Wasn't he the made-up player we put on our roster during the cancelled 2010 season?

I give up. Either someone here takes them or they get released. NO, I HATE THIS GAME AND I'M DONE. That charizard is my first take care of it. No, I want you to take all my pokemon. Just take it. If you won't take my pokemon I'll release them all. 1 year I have tried to join this league, and I failed, so, what pokemon do you want from me? At least one. I've been meaning to join ever since I first learned about it. So I don't want them tp go to waste. That was my last battle. I did. I failed. Not only once but twice trying out for dark. I meant the DE/Omnipotent league. Go online. I have a team made, not out of stats, but each given to me from different friends, one more and I'm done for a while. And dark and fire didn't work out. My best is ghost but that's tsken. Welp, there gows my trying out for fighting option.  K. I don't have any ice types and by the time I make a team it'll be taken. Don't get me wrong tho, ice is pretty cool, but I only have articuno. I have a moo fire team, it sux. I can't do it in time. I only have 1 physcic type.  Try 10 losses to Ty or 20 to Silver. Fine, I'll try but I've no knowledge of ice types. Oops, didn't see the cpntrary. I'll fix it someday. That's 2 out of 6. -_- No thanks, I want to do it on my own. Like I could get kyurem, I'll start breeding tomorrow. You too. What was the t flame's set? Breed gallade with leaf blade. Also, you have no special defense in that team whatsoever. Ok, so long as no one else goes for ice, I should actually have a chance. You choice banded into roost....... Nice. Gotta stay unpredicable. You're already water. -_- Yep. :p Good night, tomorrow is a heavy breeding day for me. I have to chanhe my articuno and get more ice types. T_T Great, now I have to breed TONS of pokemon. T_T Alright, glalie(Ice bomb), Glaceon (REALLY HEAVY special attacker) Articuno, Special wall. Cloyster, shell smasher. I like where that's going. Alright, weavile. NOw i just need a fast special attacker. Maybe. I CAME UP WITH SOMETHING GENIUS! CHOICE SCARF JYNX!!!! Ooh. It has heal bell too. Sweet. Alright, heal bell, physcic, frost breath, and energy ball for that one ground type. Well, I do have mono ice for ground hm..... I'll just go with shadow ball. Fixed my articuno's moves, just fixing evs and on to mega glalie. I'll go with what I have for now and will expand as time moves on. Back in my day, when legends were all I was good at, his name was good, leader of team reveal. *Approves* Now that I think about it, dragma was the first clan yellow clan lost to. Who wants to help me get in the league and make my articuno calm? :D T_T Thanks it's the thought that counts. :D My level 100 articuno has 384 hp. :D Ok, nearly done fixing artcuno and I think I can finish glalie today. That's only two..... https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiTB4h9WQ This makes me want to bang my face into a wall. Finished articuno, now to catch a pokemon and breed. And search out the megastone. No. I never got the demo. I never was able to get one. -__- Ok, looks like I don't have to go to shoal cave. Thanks. I can't find it. K. Still not there. I'll just go to shaol cave. Anyone have a snorunt? I thought you already had a type, at least go for something else. Great, now I have to go for poison. Change of plans, I'm going for physcic. :D Since I already have a fire mono, ok, fire it is! :D I'll just go on breeding my ice team I guess. Is there any way to breed a jynx without it becoming a smoochum and have to level it up to 30 each time. Will it work and a jynx will hatch? It's fine, I'm gonna level it up. I really don't feel like breeding right now. Ok, I want a test for mono fire. Don't have enough money. -_- Like ice. I lost to salamance 1-0. -_- I leterally have no way of getting money. -_- I know what Silver is doing but can't stop it! For crying out loud his heatran has flash fire. I can't do anything. Like to see you fight flash fire heatran with a mono fire. EVerythind. I already know what it has, it's impossible. Well, can I be fire elite? Ok, so I have everything for super effective mons, but not other fire types. I have an idea for my team battle me agaion when you get the chance. I used swampart for a WC. The epic dude. I wish I could get a heatran. The derp. Kek. Would a mixed zard y with EQ work? :p K. Any recommended defogers? I was gonna use swampart with SR as my WC. Also, I can't get a heatran. What is happening? I can't spend that much time soft reseting, you know my luck by now. I'm gonna get a growlithe, any recommendations for arcanine? Want a medicham or cameruot? Kek, thanks. I have no clue why this growlithe is taking so long to breed. *Parent calls me again* Oh yeah, that's why. -_- I'm going to attempt to finish arcanine. Still ev training. Oh, so you'll help me finish it? ^-_- AWESOME!! ^We ^care? What'd I say? ^You ^too. Ypu do that. I'm levelig growlithe, want to test me tonight or tomorrow? Kek. Any room for me in there? -_- Silver, oh Silver, where for aught thou? Once he tests me I can be fire elite. Thanks. I swear, if I had one of those. T_T IT's 3iv and adament. I got it from a yellow clan member. Also, what does KB mean? All the slow power characters are. Oh. It also has sucker punch. You can do that? Well, I'm looking for a bold 6iv zapdos. Also, I have some grolithe's with morning sun and flare blitz if you want them, hoenn born. K. Morning sun is an egg move that can only be achieved by breeding espeon with grolithe. Kek. Kek. Lemm know if you want anything else later. Also, for absol, I'll pretty much take any good iv legend that can be used in flat rules. Kek. I noticed. https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYIHAAAEAAAFVHwfIMzv1g We are reking the language barrier. I can tell. *Sighs with Nick*\n What's a city bot?\n\n I know him.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAH! XD vKilled it. C'mon Silver, we're burning moonlight. Hurry ap. Can you test me for fire elite? https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiUL8gxHA This hurts. Silver tested my fire team, and I changed it accordsing to is reccomendations. When I have my fire sprite I want a shiny moltres. Arcanine. I translated it, and I think now you're just blurbning random stuff.\n\n OU. -_- Wut? And mine is on the way. :D Dang, if I knew All would use his chansey. What'd ya think all. Great, lost to all's garchomp, of course. -_- Ant Ty said my charizard's flare blitz would do over half damage to chansey. -_- Blasphemy.  GG. -_- Your point, you could've had my arcanine too, which had a better chance of ending that dang chansey. I forgot, some in attack. I'm mock battling myself. Even the CPU me gets hax. -_- Great, double air slash flinch, wish my air slash hit. -_- Lel. XD What do you think? Y. Ty gave me a mixed set. #CHECK THE BV WOMAN! Oh kek. It almost did the trick, he like, 30 hp left. T_T IT WAS SO CLOSE!!! I would've had him the next run but he switched. #WATCH THE BV WOMAN! *Grows impatient for answer* It was in orange. -_- I already have darminatan and arcanine. You shawtup. Mixed X? Well, I need a mixed fire mega. Also, charizard X has the same attack and sp. attack. -_- *Grows more impatient for an answer if he can be fire elite.* *he* I'm as calm as a darmanitan. What...do...you....mean...good....start? It's only weak to grass. What...do...you....mean? WELL? SO????? WHAT? So? It was obvious you were going for garchomp.  Can I be fire elite? It's a constant reminder of who gave it to me.  /tweaking.  Oh sure, pit me against the rock elite. -_- He better hope not, because rock types have another thing coming. *Coughs swampart, solarbeam, and earthquake* I'm making mah team, hold on. Aden2 http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/battle-ou-203980872 Sorry, gtg, my parent is forcing more work on me n a holdiay. Back, parents forced me to do math. -_- Also, I'm just gonna go with plain old special charizard since it has d pulse for dragons. Wanna go again? I lost to all's garchomp. -_- Ok. I had to go. I wanna finsih our battle. Will anyone else test my fire team before I have to do more math? K. Well, where is he? 0_0 If I'm not fire elite I'm just gonna give up joining the league. However, I still have a chance. Why/how is that? Ok. K. http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/battle-ou-203993924 I had to go again.  I don't rq against friends. Sure, say gg then come back here and brag about how my will o wisps miss. Why do you guys keep thinking I'm rq'ing? Jerks. I know it isn't. -_- 2552-3379-7757\nAlright turtle, let's settle this in smash. ? Dang it, after the wii u version the 3ds version feels weird. Yep. 2-0's turtle the ness spammer. Settled. Excuses excuses. Ikr XD It was a smash ball that neither of us touched. I gave up on joining the league, it seems as though there is always someone one step ahead. I'm back from sulking over how I lost fire. Nothing like building custom stages to make you feel a little better..... A little. Turtle won by a speed tie. Yep. Tru. -_- He claims to have a scarfed mega charizard. It was smogon OU. He didn't, it was a speed tie and he won it. Yes Brett, I do also have a canon stage. XD XD XD I did, look, what are you talking about? Hey. That hurt my feelings.  I don't even know why you have games if you can NEVER PLAY THEM!  OH YEAH! Gotta love lon'que. Want to 1 v 1? Why nah? Who's the idiot that put that as my flair. Ok then jerk, I'm leaving. Tommorrow I get powersaves. -_- XD To think that tomorrow I will be able to get that keldeo. Ok, so, any tips for when I get it? I'm gonna trade pokemon to my old 3ds and mod it from there. You stop. You stop being a hypocrite. ? Sure, as soon as you explain how I am currently being a hypocrite.\n\n :D :R I went on for fun mode.... A giga mac side b'd off the edge...... -_- I plugged in psaves, now what? -_- Where do I find the license key? Nvm, I found it. I'm psaving using my old 3ds and my old pokemon X. Ok. HOURS OF WORK IN SECONDS?! No wonder Silver had an advantage! What was the item keldeo held on the previous set of the week? Silver got ssbu? XD Oh...... Kek. I HATE THESE THINGS!!!! *Shinifies his manectric* EVIIIIIL! *Gives his new mega sableye the mega stone* AWFUL If the exp to next levek is a negative number, is that a bad sign? How do I fix it? I'll undo it and just use rare candies. :p Tell me my game will get corrupted one more time. Kek, I'm trading all rhe psave stuff back to my old X version. Now what? Ok, I'm safe..... Thank goodness my natural cautioness had me psave on my old game. My version of OR along with all my mns are finw. Now what do I do with my soon to be ded X version? Ok, my smash mentor told me to use my back up I made a bit ago. Brb, I'm gonna back up my X version. My X is, but I have a back up. It's for the version I psaved in. So, my X version is trash now? Modifyied then traded toOR. I backed up before this. But my gme is still playing right noq. And what happens to the data? You mean my X or my OR version? I traded them back. Then released them in X What are the chances of bad thinga in OR/AS? Something else like what? And what good are back ups when my game is corrupted. That's becauese you know how to use them and had guidance on wbat you were doing unlike me who came here and cgot caled a hypocrite while permanently ending my pokwmon career. What do you mean? I did one at a time all.  Ok, there'a only one thing to do! I need someone here to take my competitve mona, and keep them until the next pokemon games come out. It doesn't matter, I might gwt a new ORAS before then, but I need someone to do this. Well? You can save it, but only one of you guys can help me right now. I don't have much time. You said it yourself, it will be corrupted soon.  I got it because 1.]  I couldn't get good legends. 2.] All of you encouraged it 3.] I can't beat Siver's legends without my own. You mean... About corruption.... You....were....  joking...... ,ajjwkyajqkudmaowwjdnaamwwlwoamqkamak http://gifvault.com/spongebob-gif-245.html This current user is unavailable......

Or was it just saying.. Hey,  I'M UNLEGIT BRUH! They took all my battling energy.... And I lost my roserade.... I didn't, I gotscared when I saw the word corrupted and a negative exp to next lwvel. Are ,y psaves still ok for use? I wanna make surebefore I awaken tomorrow. I have psaves and the guys tricked me into thinking my game was corrupted. Well, if a smash match is set up I can  sure to expect a lot of new comments. I'm still working on making a new uber team. It's meant for silver. &gt;:D Now that I have psaves, it's a level playing field. As far as pokemon go, I can have access to pokemon I didn't before! What is happening? That explains it. *Doesn't join* XD Yup yup. #100% REAL! Ok, lemme just do something real quick. You host. That's what happened to me yesterday. Host. Ty, how do you expect to fight and be on reddit?  After this. 7.8/10 Ty. *Loses to two sd's* Time for my main. *Ty leaves* Yeah right. \nbut fine, next time I'll use my main. Ty, I wanna organize mah team some more. Mah mons ain't ready yet. LATER. Also, want any psave stuff? Kek, I threw a team together.  Once again they try to convince me I corrupted my game. -_- I figured out how to use psaves late yesterday. &gt;:D Great, can't do anything to chansey. Didn't realize my team needs more attack power. It does less than half. *Gets two crits on chansey* :O *Wins with latios* Told ya so about legends. -_- What version? About what? No. I do 4x better on the Wii U. You won't. -_- Me what? They just ignore it, simple. :p *Notices how it's a copy of  my old ccincino's set* Anyone have a ccincino? I gave mine to toshiro after it missed 9/10's of the time. *Asks for a HA ccincino* I told that to my ccincino. :p And now because of toshiro's mega luck he can sweep me with it. Yes, but how would I get a HA ccincino? I'm still not sure how to make stuff, just modfying. Ok, so I make one, breed it, then modify? Ok, where is this code that has the directions? Knock off is a move tutor move now. I checked the website, couldn't find anything. *Lucarionite* *If it's outclassed it's a dumb ban* *Physical fighting megas need drain punch which they have*  Ok, I got how to get ccincino, what about a HA one? Not necessarily. Also, I beat Ty with latios. -_- *Does and victini&gt;lucario* Let's not even go there. I didn't get an HA ccincino. :O Nvm, I soft reseted and got it! :D I was showing how even  I can use a latios. -_- Right here, I'm just ignoring the uber nub. It's only average speed and get's one hitted by everything. I got it, I'm just gonna breed it to make it kalos born. It was a speed tie that you won. It was a mega charizard mega idiot. &gt;:D Have any other good special sweeper ideas for fire types. I know I have an artiocuno... But why articuno? It sux.  Mind reader and sheer cold? Or frost breath. Mine's a special wall, guess I should change that. A rain team, nice. Btw, it's HA brings auto hail. I got in confused with abasnow's ability. Oh wait, nvm. What do you mean ? I got snow warming confused with snow cloak. MY pokeman livel is rising. DISCRIMINATION! New item for a wallish skill link user..... Shell bell, recover hp each hit. 5x shell bell, if there was a wall worthy skill link user it'd go straight to ubers. No, think grass, water, and fire. Nate, leader of AFC is my first clan that I made an alliance with..... VENGEANCE! Black hole? YUMMY YUMMY!\n *Pac mans his moveset* XD https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiZR5_zrQ XD Heretic. Don't do it, use rare candies. It'll show a negative number in the exp to next level at level 100. It'll basically say...... HEY, I'M HACKED! :D Oh.... That's how it works......  Uhh..... Can I reset my manectric's level? https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiZUYTYwg I already nicknamed mine supah sanic. Lel XD #0_0 Hm...................................... Huh....................................... I'll mod it then give you one. Uhh.... What set is it? Ok, what set is it anyway? :p Go oline, be there soon. Kek, I'm coming online. You owe me a clone of your diancie for this. I dunno, both? Mixed I guess. Dang it, I can't change it. I'm not risking my OR by putting it in psaves. XD Tell meh a latias set. K. You host. Coming. Nick's one of THOSE jigglypuffs. If only I could teach defog. Calculating chance of salamance.... *Laughs as nick attempts to copy for glory shulks* Smaah bruhs for wii u tho. Maybe. ^ Hold up, I'm preparing mah mega. C'MON RARECANDIES!!!! *Takes out his stall team* My tea is ready. That's stuoid. Fine, lemme just bring sweepers and target you... My team is ready and firing to go! He's ryan. Ok, let's all play defenseive! :D *Sees Nick's sableye* 0_0 -_- This is sparta. Lemme take down the guy next to me. I have a sweep chance. Get charizard. Yep, his roserade is de. *des* *ded* : D I'ma get you too win. I'm less of a threat than a wall. My plan worked! :D I was soul dew. Exactly. XD You already took my sableye. T_T You were vulnerable to latios, and you got me first turn. I'd join but they're angry. T_T He started war when he moonblasted my sableye. I'ma leave reddit till next Friday. Later. Can you battle one time with invoking more needless hate on me? SHUT THE HECK UP ALREADY!!!! I WANTED A FRIENDLY BATTLE. Well, since we can't have a friendly battle that was our last.  Tie, I left reddit, I'm on miiverse now. Ty, I made two teams based on day and night, I need a mixed wall for my day team. I dunno, I just need ideas for a mixed wall/ sweeper. I already have a mega. Kek. He doesn't do it on purpose, once, he was winning and still dc'd. My pokemon team of day has a hole in it. -_- If my day team was ready you'd be so rekt right now.

That sucked. Defense with the slow start. Happens more than you'd think. I wish the defense didn't need to wait until halftime to get their shit together sometimes. Happened against the Packers too. Offense can't be similarly slow or this going to be a long game. Kickoff return TD pls. Amendola you can do it. I hate you Danny Amendola. Probably going to get overturned. I don't think there's indisputable evidence to turn that over but it seems like they're always willing to overturn the ruling of the field in these kinds of cases. Defense needs to make a play. This is an offense that's been shut down often enough in the regular season. For a team that hasn't done anything in this game yet and is down two scores, I got to say I'm not that nervous. The Patriots haven't got where they are without making an adjustment or two. Still a lot of football left to play. Can't run the ball for shit. Might not need to, but it's going to make them one-dimensional. BRADY THE MOBILE QUARTERBACK. What happened when the Broncos went up 24 in the first half at Gillette a couple years back? It's never too late. The point is, a bad start doesn't mean a bad finish. Come on, the run defense can't be this soft. How did he get hurt away from the play on an outside run... I can't believe how bad this team's run defense can be sometimes. The Jets did the same thing to them. 4 yards can not be a good stop... What the hell. Unnecessary roughness on a WR. The Patriots punt block unit has been good this year. I'm concerned about not having a run game. Suggs is going to be mad about that one. Wendell you suck. I hope next year's first round pick a guard. McPhee being a piece of work when Brady was on the ground. Are you kidding. Don't call a damn taunt there. That happens on every damn kick return ever. What a stupid penalty. lol Absolutely not PI. Could have been a shitty illegal contact call, but he wasn't interfered with. You can't bump him at the first down marker. Tom Brady is going to be our damn leading rusher. Amendola making up for his past sins! How's New Jersey? What the hell. That was like a pass. Let's see a Tucker miss for old time's sake. Are you kidding. That's horse shit.  lol. what the hell is that. they should throw a late flag. I hope there is a make-up call there, because it would be well deserved. Mosley got away with one. Need a turnover. Somehow the only unit of the Patriots that's done a good job is the offensive passing attack and they're only down 7. Defense needs to make a stop here. Preferably a turnover if they can possibly muster it. The offense is capable, but they can't win the game without any help. THAT WAS THE GREATEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. Someone is going to hire McDaniels. i love this game. That's disappointing but I'm not that mad. Both units showed heart and the game is tied. I can trust the defense. my fucking god. after the shit they let mosley get away with that is completely outrageous. So call Mosley for a worse damn hold. If it's the right call make it every time it's the right call. run an end around. Touchdown drive and call it a day. please. please. Drive down the field, score a TD and then shut them down to close it out. make it fucking happen. He's down. Why the fuck would you rule the a turnover on the field he's down. This is a horribly officiated game. Not just in terms of flags but getting the right call on the field too. That doesn't mean you make the wrong call because you'll get a second chance. Besides that, they need indisputable video evidence. If Vereen is down there but there's a player in the way then there wrong call stands. That's not even true. They try and make the right call on the field, they just didn't. Yes. I am happy. pass rush pls. Come on defense. Lions offense has already done better than I expected them to. Devastating penalty. That's going to set Dallas' offense up nicely. Come on now, this isn't the 49ers against the Raiders. We can't call this one just yet. I really thought the Lions offense would struggle a lot more than this. Moving the ball pretty well though. Bean bags. A Cowboys win just leads to so much better divisional round match-ups.  Romo has got to stop taking those sacks. Throw it out of the back of the end zone. Dallas can get Detroit in bad positions. Backed up in their end zone, facing third and long, but they just can't make plays once they're there. lol, pretty much everything went the lions way in the first half. the refs aren't biased. Tony Clutch-mo. Just fall on the damn ball. Rookie mistake. I don't really understand electing to receive in a situation like that. Do the Cowboys always do that? This is going to be a good game but I can't help but be a bit worried we're a couple hits like that away from a Brandon Weeden/Matt Flynn duel. Tell me how you really feel? Bucs in 6. He got sacked from the ground lol. For a second I thought that the Packers would recover from the bad snap and make a play. \"Like an Edelman.\"? Beasley to throw a 50-yard TD today! Wow. What was the secondary doing there. Just let him run it in. If the Patriots make it to the SuperBowl the team they match up best with is probably the Packers, but damn it if I wouldn't be okay seeing Tony Romo make a run. Don't worry GB, going down 2 scores at home is all part of the plan. That's why the pats kept doing it. Meaning that he hadn't been too involved in the game prior to that play. How many play callers does Dallas have? Callahan, Linehan, and Garret could all do the job at various times. The Cowboys are a good football team. Guess it works for them. Matthews is doing a great job getting into the backfield but that's not the first time he hasn't made the play once he's there. Weird situation, because I can't recall the booth ever buzzing down to get a better spot on a play. Phew. Romo narrowly avoiding disaster. False starts on missed FGs are so weird. How do you miss even more right? Oh it got partially blocked. From the angle behind Cobb it looks like it hits the ground before he has control. That's an awful call. From behind it clearly hit the ground. There is no way you can look at the angle from behind Cobb and think he had control before the ball touched the ground. BALLL DON'T LIE! Mason Crosby not the guy I want as my kicker in this spot. Sometimes. Other times he's bad. He's okay. Great kickers don't have years where they kick at 63%. Can't help but remember 2012. Cowboys want to strip the ball from Eddie Lacy. There's going to be a fumble sooner or later. Rodgers is just missing throws today. Overthrowing a bunch of them. Romo chucks the ball with his eyes closed. Lol Doesn't look like it was tipped to me. Shouldn't that be obvious? No, it's not. Huh. Can't remember challenging that many plays in the regular season in the first place. Come on Murray what the hell are you doing with that shit. Wasn't Green Peppers going to retire before he signed with GB? What a fortunate signing. John Kuhn is a pro-bowler because if you asked someone to name a fullback he's one of the few people remember. Packers went crazy.... It's TJ Lang. The whistle was blown when he hit the Cowboys player. Rush so few and still give up the long pass with poor coverage. That's not good Dallas. The Panthers owe a lot to Mike Nugent not being able to kick a routine field goal to win his team a game. Yep, that's bad. Man, this game is going to get ugly. Cardinals might get 3 here but they look severely outmatched. Keep calling penalties till Arizona makes it into the endzone. It's going to take a lot to make this competitive. Wow. Larry Fitzgerald open and Lindley can't hit him. If you can't throw to him you can't throw to anybody. Fitz knows how important every single yard is. He wanted to make it into the endzone there Ryan Lindley has a touchdown in the playoffs. tell me how you really feel. Cam really likes to target Ed Dickson. That's a team that's drafting a punter. San Diego's kicker was a better punter than Arizona's punter. Cam Newton is one of the few quarterbacks that could save that from being a pick-6. BACKUP HAND OFFS. you have got to be kidding me. i think he broke the plane before he fumbled. TD. arians should throw the challenge flag and pretend it fell out again. The first half of this game is a good metaphor for Arizona's season. It doesn't really make sense, and I'm not quite sure how it happened, but the Cardinals are winning. Chris Berman sounds like he's talking with his mouth full. Where's analytical Ron. I think after three you get kicked from the game. At least in Madden. Arizona has a bad offense and a bad punter, but a decent defense. Play to their weaknesses. There was no clear recovery there was there. So they'd just get the yardage lost not the possession. Still worth a challenge I guess. Cam making it interesting.

Why? It's my money, it's your job and you have your employer to pay you. \n\nEdit : Downvote all you want. Mandatory tipping is still the stupidest thing I can think of American customs.  &gt; not tipping is just assholish.\n\nOther people have lives too. We're also struggling to feed our families. Tipping is just showing that *extra gratitude* to someone. **It is not suppose to be mandatory**. Either them be a cab driver, a waiter/waitress, they have *no right to be angry when we, as customers, decided not to tip*. FYI, in my place, you show gratitude by simply saying thank you. \n\nAn asshole is just someone who intentionally make their job harder, which in case causing them to do extra work.  So, \"service quality\" is based on customers? I thought every worker should be doing a good job to impress their employer. Not the customers. &gt; customer happiness is very important. This isn't some desk job where you have to impress the boss, it's about making customers happy and making sure they come back and tell their friends too. That's how a restaurant succeeds.\n\nYes, of course. But that should be done whether you get tipped or not. It's common sense to have a good attitude while doing your job, towards the customers especially. Being \"I'm surely not gonna serve this guy well because he never tips me\" is a childish and selfish attitude. If you really want to do the best in your job, the tips don't matter. You're getting out of context. \n\nFirst, I was saying that tips should not be a basis to determine your work attitude.\n\nSecond, $2.83 may not be enough for a living, but that is not the customer's responsibility (to determine your wage). It is the employer's/manager's.\n\nThird, if you think you're doing a great job serving people that they keep coming back to the restaurant, see your boss and ask for a more deserving wage.\n\nAll in all, tips should not be mandatory. It is up to the customer's discretion whether they *want* to tip or not. Servers have no right to be upset or be mad about not getting tipped. \n\n\"I'm doing super great at my job? Rather than discussing about it to my boss, why don't I ask the customers to pay my extra wage?\" \n\nNow that's delusional. Wow, when I read this it was over 9000 upvotes. I'm not even kidding.

FFFFFFUUUUUUUUCCCFCCCKKKKKKK!!!!!!!! I think you should pick Bold. Good morning ~~now bow down to your master~~ Because it can still get effected by those things (except leech seed) by stuff like Fire Blast and Sludge Bomb and i don't think an Unaware Pok\u00e9mon can be damaged by stuff like Stealth Rocks on a switch in (Not sure about the last part.) yep but imagine if your opponent got like 6 calm minds or bulk ups an unaware poke ignores the stat changes when doing damage Well when your battling a wall that you can't take out fast it might get a few calm minds up and thats game unless you crit it or a baton passer can get 1 or 2 up then baton pass and let the other poke finish setting up the calm minds I meant when your team has nothing to get rid of the poke quickly :T Im gonna try to remake green hill zone cause logic :D 5 people lurking Miiverse is not safe... https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiJNnwa3A Someone is thinking about doing my suggestion for the Breloominati bot :') (Its not for sure tho) Well they are a Japanese event :p I can give you leftovers :p (when i get my ds back Edit:btw i don't need the snivy cause its probably gonna be on power saves soon the leftovers are for free) Read the edit :p You know whats gonna be funny? when the code beggars return since the Mewtwo dlc is by code some code beggars might return lol I said when i get my ds back lol XD NNNOOOOOOO!

Im completely fine with the second option but i suck at battles where i can only use 3 pokes unless its a ffa or team battle i didn't use its mega and it didn't? someone told me it was banned cause it was too good of a baton passer oh if it switches in or uses an ice type or dark type attack it almost always gets ohkoed by a mach punch Probably is on power saves right now but i don't have my ds :T dood ice beam You can thank  my mom. np I think its elites only so if you get flying yus or fire Yus do you want me to take a picture? i don't know no one leaves a special attacker in against chansey anyway unless they don't have any psychical attackers left on there team Edit: Or the special attacker has psyshock Yup What if he named a other pok\u00e9mon Hoopa to make you think that? *[MERICA]( https://whereisrusnivek.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/17e1017f9869f8c22e36ff6ceac468cbab7a1f006d748f5f0464a92cd0a08cb4.jpg?w=624&amp;h=474)!

I could have sworn you did... unless... Friday 13th in this February Your not serious right? you don't know they porting wii games to the e shop? It means someone takes a game and makes it compatible with another system like how people wanted ssb3D to be ported to the ps vita cause they didn't want to buy a low powered system. Too bad you can't transfer your data i got my ds for an hour :') Well im not a approved sumitter :T have no clue i never played the first 1 smash or pkm ffa anyone? Brett y u no fight? Lmao  My plan ask my dad for a new 3ds save for a PS vita ask for a ps4 for my b-day then ask for a xbox one for chrimbus I have a room up with my cousin in ssb u if anyone wants to join During the year :D How is my cousin still alive against Junito? Get your facts straight My fox amiibo gave me one rupee in HW ._. When do you unlock Zelda in Hyrule Warriors? I just did the mission where you can play as Lana for the first time. You can thank my mom and :( 1:48 :] Yup your good at noticing jokes for that ima upvote bomb you \ud83d\ude04 Dont be sad here have a cookie\ud83c\udf6a Silver is there any game your not good at? XD I need to call Sakurai you need to be nerfed Was it good? :D :D its my new recipe cat shit flavored chocolate chip cookies! :] Ikr most likely :] :D They could just ban the move Thats why, Why wouldn't they ban a move that one Pok\u00e9mon gets? its like there banning Greninja who got two tutor move then everyone thought it needed to be banned except Greninja had move that weren't op just good for the Poke itself even Smeargle can't use the move so i don't see the point in not banning it and you would still be able to use the move in AG or Ubers :'D I know about Hyperspace fury its a stronger dark type version of Hyperspace hole i just didn't know how much damage it does. Yus but it getting those moves didn't help it probably got it banned fester and my point is  theres no point in banning a poke cause it has one op move especially if only 1 pokemon can learn it banning the move is the smart thing to do. (Example)lets say they made a poke with like 10000 base attack but it got only one psychical move and the rest of its stats are about decent for uu are you gonna put the poke in ubers or just ban it from using the move? (btw i know this would never happen thats why its an example) [YESS FUCKING YES!](http://imgur.com/j79PfUC) :') now i can lose to you and silver in mk8 in style. :p :'} Wii U or 3DS? Anyone wanna play smash or have a pokemon ffa later? my mom said she will let me train my new captain falcon amiibo later :') :] k I practice my short hop air attacks on my Captain Falcon amiibo when it was low leveled and i got better at it but now my amiibo is a god of short hop air attack XD Well i was suppose to get this for chrismas :T now its a month later Anyone wanna pkm ffa/smash in like 10-15 minutes? gamecard except for street pass data im sure my cousin gave me his kid icarus uprising when he broke his ds and it still has his save file  You can catch that in Kalos ima make a room in the wii u version with my cousin if anyone wants to join. But you said KB which means Kalos Born Brett in my cousin are in my room :} Don't forget mute city Junito Brett and my cousin interesting Are you guy's still playing mk8? Can I join? Sigh my disk was dirty :T I was about to get 4th place then my wifi went out Nah 3 cpu s with stars behind me BS Wrong comment I won a race? :0 Smash? :( If someone uses the reddit is fun app the down vote button is still there :0 Its the truth my brother worked there too i thought that game comes out the same day as the new 3DS xl Make this happen nintendo https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiQwy00bQ ? So? it would still work  About 95% follows that format at least from what i seen his spike is easy to do well at least for me and my brother it is. You main Sanic? give me a bro fist My dad said he is gonna get me the new 3DS xl :'D but he said he might not be able to afford it at launch so sometime after that means i can save my allowance then by the end of june be able to buy a ps vita! lolno cheap? maybe but it feels so good to do. Naw a flawless combo is the best way to kill someone there is so much satisfaction when you kill someone with a combo you mastered especially if its a difficult combo :') Well he mains Sanic and its hard AF to spike with him especially in a intense match and you always gotta remember to double jump before spiking or you gonna kill yourself. i wann try to use greninjas taunt to kill :p even if its almost impossible :D Well i haven't had a playstation since i was like 8 then my dad gets me a ps4 for my b-day :D  XD what our your guys thoughts on this team im testing? http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-203130694 my real weakness is anything with a steel type move that a cant ohko or 2hko in omastars or tyranitars case meh psychic vs psychic? depends on the set and team my showdown name is nisky808 i will be in the lc chatroom D: stop clearing your cookies im testing and im probably gonna change it to ice beam lmao there should be a setting to turn off when you clear your history but it will happen each time till you turn clear cookies off Oh then you team is gonna be deleted each time cause the wii u automatically clears your cookies when you close the browser and theres no way to stop it you have to use a laptop tablet or phone for showdown if you wanna save your teams i wanna get the mh4u new 3DS simply cause of how awesome the 3DS looks i could care less about the game though lol i thino my wii u gamepad charger is about to break D: sorry ps vita your gonna have to wait to july showdown? its not my fault my parents kick the shit daily and refuse to look at the floor even when its almost completely out of the way they still end up kicking it :'( oh then i can't test you :T Ikr when i plug it in now it either doesnt charge or it blinks constantly to its charging normally till someone moves the wire i know luckily before the month ends i should have enough money to get my sanic amiibo and the charger i just gotta wait two more weeks for the vita by the end of this year  yus *sony releases ps5 in 2016* FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUU lmao i copied my css to my notebook now if ayone trolls meh i can put it back :D me want oh better erase that from mai notebook lol here you go for those looking http://www.gateway-3ds-buy.com/ 1351 roms?! fuck me wants ME NEED! http://roms43.com/roms/3DS/  I think they made or are making a update for that and you cant gen with that ._. holy shit i need this fuck the vita i already know this lol I kinda still want the vita lol so I might get that first then get gateway I'm gonna have all dem hacks ?

Could easily be a TD if not for the DPI they decided not to call. Completely bailed out. ATTA BOY LAWRENCE  Like we haven't had worse than that said to us numerous times. You mean where the refs blew calls against both teams, significantly favoring the Lions in the first half? Lol okay. Plenty, and it was overturned.

(At least this is the impression I've gotten, correct me if its not the case) I've heard its mainly a North American and central/north European thing for children to leave their parents as soon as possible.  \nI live in Norway and was happy when I moved away from my parents and bought my own place in my early 20's, and can never imagine living there now as a 25 year old.\n\n^^Edit: ^^word. Yeah I can totally understand that. Here in Norway it was almost the opposite in some way. Our church and state only separated about 5 years ago, and people did not care about the subject since it never had any effects on politics or other matter. I for one was not even aware about even before I read about it when they separated.  \nLuckily religion is more or less non existent in our politics, we even have a Christian political party that ruled about 10 years ago, but the only \"Christian-related\" stuff they really did was to focus on good values such as family life and caring for the less fortunate. Just the thought of the current prime-minster here in Norway saying something like that make me cringe, it would just be so out of place and strange. And it would probably create some either small or big headlines in the news as well. Its pretty common among us \"blue-collar\" workers without a higher education to buy our own place (usually an apartment) in our early 20's. Its pretty common among us \"blue-collar\" workers without a higher education to buy our own place(usually an apartment) in our early 20's. More or less everyone I know around my age without a higher education bought their own place in their early 20's. And a lot of my friends that just finished their education last year have bought their own place now at the age of 25. True (as a matter of fact 50% of Norway's population immigrated to the US. So there are just at many Americans with Norwegian heritage as there are Norwegians in Norway). But anyways, I have heard that in Northern Europe it has been more common to own your own place that most other places in the world for several hundred years. I think it had something to do with our small populations and lots of easy access to building materials that made it so. And if that is the case its only natural that this line of thought got brought to the US. Witch again also had a small population for its size plus a lot of easy assess to building materials. I have a pretty average income of about 64K$ (US) a year, so its nothing to brag about here. And the real estate is very expensive, its been almost out of control the last 10 years. A typical house in the suburbs outside one of our big cities will cost about 670-800k$ As for my small-medium sized apartment that is located in such a place I paid about 340k$ Thanks :) And good luck on your own voyage of ownership :) I have a pretty average Norwegian income of about 64K$ a year. He-he, I guess it was my lucky day in gathering internet points :) Yeah that is kind of ironic. Here in Norway (witch is among the 10 least religious countries in the world) we still have a bunch of Christian holidays. Easter and everything related around Jesus death, resurrection and accidence to heaven is paid holidays here (witch total about 7 days I think). Not to mention Christmas times witch also has 3 paid holidays. Plus it is only 5 years since our state and church separated. No I had about 120K saved up so I did not have enough to meet the 15% rule, so my parents had to sign up as security. But since my income have gone up and my apartment have risen in price they no longer stand security for me and everything is 100% on my own now. Is is prohibited to only practice religion or is it not taught all together?\n\nI had actually never heard of God, Jesus or religion in general before we learned about it in the first grade (This was in Norway). But we did have religious teachings trough the entire school, but it was thought as history and not as fact.\n Not as I'am aware of. Its certainly not like that here in the Nordic countries (I have never heard anyone of our politicians saying something religious), and I think its the same for the rest of Europe as well. Its quite common for people in their early to mid 20's to buy their own place here in Norway. Especially for people like me without a higher education and start working when we are 18. I have a average income and have no problem paying on my mortgage, bills and everything else and still be able to save up money each month.\n\n&gt;Let's say one day you got hit by a bus or something, how'd you manage to pay for anything at all?\n\nI'am assuming that is just a rhetorical question? But if not, as I said I live in Norway and we have basically free health-care here, so that would not be a problem. Plus we have one years paid sick-leave (its the law) so I would earn my normal salary for a year if I where hospitalized and had to say home for a long time after if I got hit by a bus.", "topic_full": "fucking shit look cowboys game football damn play make oh", "label": "Helix1337", "topic_id": "topic_0", "topic_distr": [0.55266673033893121, 0.44522195965613331, 0.00026391590884191561, 0.00026392067372885505, 0.0002639189060549763, 0.00026390599570806942, 0.00026390847552933643, 0.00026392443693536654, 0.00026390712604872779, 0.00026390848208812494], "mean_infl": 0.00039598253182806896}], ["Amberleaf29", {"topic_repr": "play fuck let", "text": " I knew an extreme tech nerd in high school who works for the Geek Squad at Best Buy now.

But, the other Cowboys were still trying to wrestle Davante Adams to the ground, even after the Lang hit.\n2. The play was not blown dead, and that's why the 4 Cowboys were still wrestling Adams to the ground.  If that's the case, then Lang was trying to get the defenders off of his receiver.\n\nI don't think it was THAT dirty, but I'm of course biased.

The Ravens look impressive so far but so did the Lions early last week. All the Pats need to do is put Dan Connolly on kick returns. It looks like Smitty isn't the only one fired up, nice drive by the Pats.  We've got a game! Between Williams and Ngata the Ravens have got a lot of beef in that D-Line. I was thinking the game was starting to devolve into mediocrity and then Amendola goes and makes a great play.  Should be fun finishing off the half. Great catch by Daniels in a crowd for the TD. Gronkowski doing that gronking thing that he gronks so well. He threw himself into that O-Lineman and blew up the play.  Guy's got balls. Edleman: \"Stand back boys, I'm a professional\" Brady has been on the ground a lot tonight, we'll see if it takes it's toll in the 4th quarter. The Ravens' running game is so good there is no reason to pass. I may be early but this feels like it's going to end up in OT. This is the way it should be, deciding it in the last 2 minutes.  No matter how it ends it has been a great game. The Dragon just got snuffed. I'm 0-3 for my playoff predictions so far, sorry Lions. Snow on your dish? Cardinals were a gut feeling.  I didn't know A.J. Green was out for the Bengals. Last year 3 home teams lost in the Wildcard round. Nice play by Stafford avoiding the rush and finding Tate downfield. I wish they'd get this weather advisory off of my screen.  Yes it's fucking cold outside, that's why we're all inside watching the game. Great blocking on the TD run for Bush.  The Lions look like they've got their act together. This is the Lions team I expected to see all season.  I know they are capable of being scary good. Stafford doing his Brett Favre imitation on that long ball. Damn.  Looks like the wheels are starting to come off the wagon for the Lions. Leon Lett was a pretty good defensive lineman, shame he'll be remembered for a couple of mistakes. Looking forward to a great game, hopefully Rodgers leg won't explode into a million pieces and if it does there's always Flynnsanity.   I hope the Cowboy fans who made it to Green Bay were treated well by the Packers Fans and that they enjoyed the food and drink so that the trip won't be a total failure when they go home with a loss. Hope Tony's back holds up too.  The games are always the best when teams have their best players on the field.  I got my pregame walk done, got my Bart Starr throwback jersey on, the liquid refreshments are chilled, and my Cheesy Chex Mix waiting to be opened.  I am at one with the universe so I'm sorry Cowboy Fans but you are doomed.  I wish the Packers would bring in Alvin Stychinski and his Polka band to do the National Anthem, bring a little Wisconsin culture into it. Buckle up that chinstrap, lace up those cleats, and cinch up those shoulder pads,  IT'S GAME TIME!  GO PACK GO!!! That modified pistol formation seems to be working well.  Someone remind McCarthy that it works in the 2nd half. Did they have the flyover before the game?  I must have seen 10 stories about the Green Bay pilot doing it on the news this week.  7-7 at the end of the 1st quarter is about where I expected it to be, not happy about how it got that way but that's life. That one is on Rodgers, all Lindley heard was the double clap which means hike the ball. The fans in Lambeau need to get loud, it's a football game not a funeral. Tight Ends over the middle have been the bane of our defenses existence all year, why can't they cover that better. It could be a lot worse than being down by 4 at the half.  Rodgers looks like a sitting duck stuck in the pocket.   It doesn't look tipped to me. YES! Playoff time is here!  Good luck to all, best of luck to my team! Hope the offenses can score some points or we're looking at a 6-5 kind of game. I see you're living life large. Considering what I expected from this game it's turned into a track meet. Very well done, a good read and a fair assessment. My wife just filled me up with ham and garlic mashed red skins, my challenge for the 2nd half is to stay awake. The Cards had Logan in for a play in the 1st half for the run option, why not try it again?   There's your dagger.  Stick a fork in the Cards, they are done.

What the hell are you on about?  Man Tate... You beasting! We messed up letting you go. Happy for your success!! Boy if there was ever a game for Lions D to show up... This was it. Lol this Chevy Colorado commercial. Camera perspective makes this tiny truck look huge. That was a cheapshot slap to the helmet by Tate after the play was over. How did the refs miss that??? Well that blitz got a bit of a rise out of Joe Buck. Well that blitz got a bit of a rise out of Joe Buck. it seems like it is a Lifetime movie. That's like the third or forth underthrown pass... Romo must be hurt. **EPIC FAIL** Lol... Here we go. Terrible call.  Lol... Here we go. Terrible call.  It looked incidental live. My view from the TV is a bit different from the field. Just saying it looked incidental as it happened. Never will blowing a call that gives a first down on the goal line be equal to a late hit on a QB. Not sure who I am rooting for here, but I don't mind seeing Scandrick getting caught just a bit behind. Cowboys fan successfully baited. I think the game will be the similar no matter who it is. I could be wrong, but expectation is higher for the Cowboys so I would revel in their loss more than the Packers losing. Lol... They don't run it!!! Lol!! That is as bad as that blown PI call to give Dallas a first and goal. Eh, you could argue a few things in this game. You should be happy to have a 4 point lead. I didn't know was the ball almost ripped out or were you hoping it was ripped out because it didn't look like it was almost ripped out to me. Why do you assume that will happen? Wagner will be locked up here soon, and all are superstars on defense are in place for years. Now we can focus on the Oline and wide receivers out of the draft. Nope... I know what this link is.  lol... Would **Definitely** been a TD.  Just score and put it to bed. O everyone saying the play was not debatable, it really was. It should've been offsetting penalties at the very least. **We have a game of full on Calvinball** I was kind of figured Rob Lowe was a cheese driller. **WOOOT**  Playoff football is here! I always picture him talking with a mouthful of grapes, or chocolate malt balls. If not, it may be a Seattle hat trick! No kidding... I am watching a stream originating in Austin or Dallas or somewhere. I was enjoying those Texas furniture, liquor and gun commercials. Holy crap... they saw that coming from a  mile away. god that massive hold... Boy Cards run d showing up. I don't think Cam is going to survive this game. Looking rough everytime he goes down. This game is rigged. well this game convinced me, games can be fixed. \"You don't get to say you agree that call was weak, but...\" You are blind and homering hard if you think that was close to a good call. These refs are clearly interfering with this game. oh god... this is a complete disaster of a game.  Well that rule is going to come under some scrutiny... I am not sure they intend a penalty from bad decision to throw a ball should be negated by defense making contact. You gotta be joking. The damage is done and has completely altered the momentum of this game. The Panthers look like crap, and only less so because of ref interference. I don't have a horse in this game. You are completely homering if you think the last two scores have been earned... They were gifted to you guys. They are terrible, but they got this one right. There was massive holding on that play. You could hear Gruden see it and talk around it. I think the 3rd quarter completely demoralized the Cardinals. Its hard enough to compete when you know your offense is suspect, even harder when you have brutal calls go against you. \n\n I said it was suspect... I was trying to be nice.

We're bringing it back to the smooth sounds of the 90s. If AZ won the toss, why wouldn't they defer? My family is from Wisconsin but moved when I was young. When I used to come to visit my grandfather would take me to Brewers games in the summer at the old Milwaukee stadium. I still remember that place. Good times. Best percentage of touchbacks? That's a weird way to put it. I would say it feels good to have a run defense but I know AZ is struggling with their running game. That is a stop. 2 of the worst punting teams in the league? We are a good matchup. I love the hate. Jesus Kelvin! Tuck that ball. Giving me anxiety. Nice block Stewart. Fuck yeah J-Stew! Smash is back! TD don't need no ACL. You can stop tackling him now. We had Hardy for one game. Damnit Bersin. Great 4th down conversion AZ. Let's not turn this into another 49ers game. Jesus Fitzgerald is a beast. Bersin cost us 7 points. It looks like Fozzy is our return man from here on out. There was a Cardinal fan who called Stewart the most average RB in the league the other day. Not sure he agrees. Why do they keep on slowing us down for the snap? Fucking Gano! We need a new kicker. Is Stanton on IR? Third leg Greg! Nice punt! Nortman is the only thing I like about our special teams. Bersin, you don't need to catch those. They are going out. With the way Cam is throwing, I knew that an interception was coming. Get your head right Cam. That's close. The one angle makes it look like a TD, though. It looks like Shula remembered running was working. The red zone, Shula's arch-nemesis.  Like these Philly cheers. Hope he's alright. Wasn't going to start drinking bourbon until after the game. I'm going to have to reconsider. Didn't sell that read. Fucking Bersin! Put in Fozzy. That blocking got me hard. 2 RB TDs!

Arians needs to actually show these refs what PI is. I don't think they understand. There are? Where? Kuechly read that the entire time. Jesus, all our RBs came to play.

It was the first time un a wjile I even check it out. &gt;kev is downvoter confirmed.\n\nWut? I wasn't even here.\n\nGuys I give way less shits about this than you think. I'm rarely on reddit at all, and I go here only when I get bored/ tired and wanna distract myself. I'd never steal someone else's ideas, I'm creative enough and *my* ideas get stolen so much I wpuldn't do that to another person. You can stop demonizing me for no reason now. So I got unbanned. Thanks to K99 I guess. And disclaimer I haven't read the whole reaction so sorry if I'm missing something. But I find your point rather understandable so I'll get to it. \n\nFirst of all, I definitely don,t mean to insult anyone by saying I have a life. I'm simply explaining my inactivity, and I used the expression because they were accusing me of something as no-lifer as attacking rhe subreddit with downvotes :/\n\nSecond, I'm not showing the things I do as cool stuff better than hanging around here, they're just things that demand my time and are for whatever reasons in a higher priority. \n\nThird, I disagree in that a leader must be active all the time. My view is that we should be a team, where everyone contributes with their grain of sand and the leader coordinates those efforts to make it work. If this system works properly, no one will have to put to\u00f3 much time or effort. I do know however that I should be more active, and I apologize for that and promise I will eventually have more time. At first I was around all the time, back on Miiverse. I learned it wasn't good for me to spend so much time on something that wasn't productive. I remember having arguments with my then GF because she got mad that I didn't pay her attention when I was witj her, instead overusing my phone. \n\nAnd finally, there shouldn't be any shitstorms or arguments to begin with, and that is the problem with the original DE, the part that I wanted gone. Some guys here are to\u00f3 hostile and can't be in peace and harmony with others. There always has to be a hidden enemy to suspect, and there's always a reason to go apeshit. The fact that *I* am the enemy now is so ridiculous that just proves my point. The whole situation reminds me of Lord of the Flies. As I said before and Chibi well reminded us, I refuse to babysit a bunch of immature prepubescents who can't stop fighting. I won't accept \"not being around to stop conflict and instead saying some stuff every now and then\" as a fault. It's not supposed to be my job, and for some reason it's easy to think that it is. That's because I do want others to see it, and frankly it's because I no longer care about what you think. It's not a matter of guts, it's just a waste of time. In fact, it would be less gutsy to keep my opini\u00f3n a secret between you and me than to make it public in whatever way I can. If I'm honest I put it together in like 5 minutes and had the idea floating on my mind, but you make me seem heroic so I wouldn't mind your version of the stpry going official :P\n\nI am however working on the final template for banmers, which is giving me a bit of a headache. There's one thing I need to clarify here: I didn't invite Toshiro, I only asked for his help. I suppose I'll have to do something in return but we'll see later what that should be. Well, I had to get the message across with someone's help because *I was banned*. Don't put it like you're more honesto or something like that. Also you're one to talk about using people, you started so many rebellions and pulled so many things like \"I'm leaving until ...\" to put people on your side, using their friendship and their will to have you around. And no changing the meaning of my words. It's a waste of time talking to you privately, not protesting about the ban and my situaci\u00f3n with most people here. Because Toshiro knows CSS... And I'd rather have few, capable people doing their stuff quietly. Doesn't look like it. Your only previous CSS contribution was madre by asking csshelp iirc. Could be my shaky memory. Sorry. Guardian orbitars? K That's a *very* bad idea. Giving everyone absolutely the same permissions will result in utter chaos and anarchy. Even Nisky admitted it judging from his experience with his own subreddit. In order to have peace there needs to be an authority that can bring order. Sure it may seem unfair that some people have more decision power than others, but it's the sad truth that only a few can make good choices. As for myself, I don't just enforce what I want or my opinion from my perspective, I do what I believe is best for the league as a whole. I may be wrong at times, but I do consider my criteria to be better and more mature. At first I tried to do everything myself, hosting all league posts on my MV profile and stuff and just worn out so I decided to share responsibilities. I *am* looking to work as a team, just one that only includes the best suited to work in it. Don't wanna risk it. Plus, I already have quite a few mods, some of them getting full or almost full permissions. Pat, Nee, Chibi. Ian, Alpha, James, AAA, Brett, Itachi and a couple more. Solid team there IMO. I appreciate your intentions and noticed a change in attitude, congrats. As for the \"say sharing\", I do want to retain more power since there are minor-ish things that I can decide more quiclkly or personally according to my taste, but I always heard you guys out. I may dismiss some things if deemed irrelevant or the kind of immature/ wrong choices, but if something is strongly proposed by enough people I do take it into account. At the very start of the DE subreddit I didn't give a fuck about the looks, then Silver started saying it was lame and others agreed, so I researched on the matter and made the changes I could. Then people asked for f\u00f1airs, I made them and everyone was happy. But then some started ranting asking for this or that type of flairs and it became a mess :/ Even when I was against it I allowed Pat to make the tcg flairs and helped him apply them, and that didn't even make everyone happy.\n\nPoint is, I'm not really tyrannical or anything, the superiority I have in terms of say is healthy imo. But what if a shitstorm arises and some elites are involved in opposing sides? Immature enough elites start deleting/ restoring comments inappropiately, or banning non-mods. Sometimes it's better to miss acting in a shitstorm due to lack of mods than to have inadequate mods making the situation worse. This kind of stuff has happened... Ik but... We should battle sometime. I hate spamming, though I do use Sonic's spin dash to move around. But I'm definitely not one of those annoying spammers... Strange, it's basically the same people as the DE... Unless you got to know eachother or something during this time. Sounds fishy... I pull the \"it's my league\" card only when stuff like Jamie putting a fucking shiny Miltank as the DE header happens. When I feel someone wants to pollute the place with shitty/ overly personal ideas. And like I said, I am there to coordinate others' inputs. The fact that I make final decisions doesn't mean that there weren't any previous debate stages or that I don't listen to anyone at all and simply do as I say. Really, with the guys over at the DE subreddit I can work in peace and we don't have any arguments, every opinion is respected and in fact I ask a lot of questions to everyone else. You can go ask them. I just don't take shit, that's all.  Keyword is *shouldn't*. Who would think there *should* be shitstorms in their \"home\" place? It's expected that at some point someone will cross some line and may trigger one, of course, but definitely something's wrong if shit hits the fan over and over, something needs to be fixed. And, should a shitstorm begin, there should be as few taking part of it and as many stopping it as possible. Which didn't happen before. Kek How'd you find that comment? Pretty dure it's buried by others already. *brofists*.\n\n1st Sanic then Shulk. Is he your secondary aswell? Amazing. I don't have any more characters I really trained with, only Charizard but I'm not as good with him. The original is a classic copypasta of 4chan. Meh, I know how to use him but I have to practice which I don't want to do. Well that's a forma of training, and that alone won't get you to true power. I'm as good with Charizard as that gets you already. It's just that I'm not *really* good with him. So Silver how did you make it possible to have an image and text flair at the same time without it getting buggy? How? I mean like having the two without them overlapping eachother. He's fest after all. No wonder he came first. Sanic can easilly run + dodge past the proyectiles. [This is one of the things I've been working on.

HOLD ME SOMEONE Man pats fans whining ALREADY? FUCK YEAH\n\n Ravens looked absolutely unstoppable on that drive. Seriously. Not a single bad play and pats D looked like the ravens' earlier this year. Please keep doing that Baltimore  Or not. That's good too Yes. Oh man so close to a perfecter start I don't think that was a catch, but I'm biased Yeah that's why I think it's incomplete. The ball hitting the ground rule seems to be for when the ball doesn't wiggle at all in your hands when it hits the ground.  #elite YES!!!  That play was close enough that I wouldn't have been mad if it stood but I'm glad it didn't! God please keep this up. I hadn't heard much at all about the ravens o line In the lead up to this. So far theyve been great FUCK YEAAAAHH!!! POUR IT ON RAVENS!!! I'm not going to relax until the clock hits 0:00 and neither should the ravens. Keep this up and make it a blowout guys. I'm not going to relax until the clock hits 0:00 and neither should the ravens. Keep this up and make it a blowout guys. I'm pulling for you so hard, but I agree. The worst loss is when you're on the receiving end of a comeback. However no better win than a playoff blowout ... You monster Uh... In case you don't know, raiders have a little issue with the Brady-belicheck patriots. Yeah. I'm not gonna call this game until it's actually over. Please don't come back tho Fucking Gronk... Fuck. Is it too much to ask for one measly shutout?  Fuck. Is it too much to ask for one measly shutout?  He juked Urlacher once Oh no... Steve... But not the just ok ones? I couldnt see. Oh god please don't do this to me Ugh. Torrey you can't do that Come on Baltimore, make the stop. Watch out for a pass to Gronk now Sacked out of field goal range. Nice. Now do that thing where you score 7 points again I like the intensity and I also like how the refs are (apparently) not gonna wimp out and do offsetting penalties. All I saw was Brady flipping out over getting touched by a knee I like how only pats fans saw a penalty on the ravens against Brady  I need a pick 6 or something. I can't handle another close game  Damn it /u/jedelman11 REF HELPED BRADY UP!!! #CONSPIRACY Edelman likes the \"run into cb to get penalty\" gambit I don't like this game anymore. Hey mr dragon we need you again. Jesus get off your high horse pats fans have bitched all game about refs Fuck first bad play call of the day for Baltimore's offense Yes Ok ravens just don't let them get up on you before the half. Yeah... That's the play you run on 3rd and 1 guys  Phew. That's gonna do wonders for morale and momentum  Fifty two Flacco's long bomb hope for PI tactic is kinda cheesy but I'm loving it here Flacco's long bomb hope for PI tactic is kinda cheesy but I'm loving it here My thoughts exactly  Oh that's gonna be a huge morale boost for halftime. Points off turnovers are crucial  Oh yea it's an overpowered rule but I won't call the tactic anything worse than cheesy. Can't be mad as long as it really is PI (and that was PI I think) If Brady hadn't made an atrocious throw then the touchdown would never have happened. So I'd say blame him? Pretty good first half, couldve been a lot better, could've been a lot worse. But 21 points won't be enough to win. Got to keep up the pressure and the ravens were getting too silly earlier Yea I see what you mean. He's kind of got this football instinct. Man I've been saying the ravens win this precise game since the preseason. I really want to be right. Last time I made a bold ravens prediction in the preseason it came true Lol It's like when they show SF during Oakland games. U say wot m8? No. They're teenage white girls who realized their friend left Facebook open I took a long piss and missed boobs. I mean Katy  Ooh... Yeah that was a PI. You guys can complain about that one pats fans.  I mean yea bad call but come on, man. Why is everyone so quick to call conspiracy against their own team? &lt;insert no more joke here&gt; Hm... Run D looking better for the pats Fuck I love gutsy play calls like that! Torrey that's your second dumb penalty. If you don't get a TD it's on you  Haha absolutely no one covering him I never thought I'd say this but Kubiak is calling REALLY well. That 4th down call was perfect. Damn if I had Brady as my qb I wouldn't give up on a game ever. The irony being Manning made it to the big game just last year and yet he's still the go to playoff choker guy  Wait I thought it was first to 28? As a former new englander, it bugs me when I hear every commentator pronounce \"route\" as if there were no silent e at the end Turnover pls. Can pats fans stop saying they've lost every other drive now? Ravens D is letting the patriots hang around. Not good. Baltimore is going to require at least one more turnover I think to pull away. Trust me it's not that kind of lead. It's a \"we're a fuck up away from blowing it\" Rob Fuck. 3 and out and I'm not liking the Baltimore D at all now.  Need another turnover now. My jaw dropped on that... Advantage patriots easily right now... That play was crushing. Im still in shock at that TD...  Oh no... Ravens D finally showing up to try and flip the momentum again Ravens got bailed the fuck out. I'd just like to say before any heart break clouds my judgement that this game is an instant classic 4th down calls... Thank you. Spotted where you fumbled it if it went forward Biggest advantage Baltimore has is they have a run game today Daniels... That was your moment man Well I feel there should have been a penalty in the end zone, but you gotta play through the calls. Get a stop now ravens Can confirm the freedom trail is fantastic. Plunderbro... For the love of god I need a turnover Fuck never mind he's down. Pats fans: if this goes against you, you have every right to be mad. Hah! That will only get the pats to lower their guard. Interception next play! Eh, pretty good for an atheist Yea... Right call. Fuck. FUCKING TACKLE THE FIRST TIME YOU FUCKS Gotta hold them here... The patriots literally don't need to run the ball... Me too. This would be soul crushing. Joe, this is your moment. Game winning 5 minute drill to cap off an epic game. Yup Who the **fuck** was saying Brady wasn't elite?  Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease Oh god this is to survive... Kubiak please! Oh god this is to survive... Kubiak please! I can't handle this...

The difference between a first down and 4th and 5 is huge.  \n  \nEspecially if they can go down and make it 14-0 I hate the ratbirds, but I'm trying to be fair Patriots playing scared.

I would just spread them out in the red zone No QB is more willing to put his body on the line than Brady Hope he's ok.  \n  \nBeating the Ravens is much sweeter if Steve Smith is on the field The D line is playing below average, but the guys on the edge are the ones really getting killed.

Ravens are getting around the outside at will Steve Smith and Suggs are the Ravens agitators, Browner is ours Flacco looked very Flacco-like on that drive.  \n  \nGood to see the universe is back in order Daryl Smith trying to cover Edelman is a joke.

Thank you Kubiak But is your family a Vikings/Bengals/Steelers/Cowboys family? Looked like they were both jostling for position Harmon looked like a deer in the headlights there. He easily could have made a play on the ball if he was paying attention. Good recognition by Flacco though. I honestly wouldn't be upset if that Pats used all 7 draft picks on offensive lineman -non Patriot fans Well our defense is supposed to be so greatly improved this year. Let's see if they can keep us in it That was the Randall Cobb play. Kubiak obviously watched the Packers tape No DPI there? But he was running where 44 was supposed to run After hearing all year about the improved o line, the improved running game, the improved defense, once again in the playoffs it all falls on Brady's shoulders For some reason Hooman is playing over Tim Wright today. So much for that Mankins trade. We could sure use him today The good old Madden seam pass Flacco's success hinges heavily on his o line. Since he's almost never been under pressure he can calmly survey the field and make good choices.  \n  \nDidn't we get Revis and Browner so that we could play single coverage and get after the QB?

Take it from Patriots fans, Carolina gets the calls when they play at home If Lindley was playing against just a pass rush and 0 db's I still don't think he would complete a pass I don't know if a more pointless playoff game has ever been played.  \n  \nAny chance either of these teams go into Seattle or Green Bay and win next week? And Cardinals fans were forever left wondering, could old Sheriff Warner have come back for one last ride? How bad must Logan Thomas be if he can't even play over this guy?

I just find it ironic. I think those laws were created largely to fight sex traffickers who use legally-registered prostitution businesses as a front to their operations. No taxes from prostitution because it's illegal, not the other way around. The way I understand it, porn wasn't legalized as well. The US Supreme Court decided on the matter, and when it said porn is covered by free speech, states were forced to regulate it instead of prohibiting it. Most states only regulated porn sale and consumption though, and only California and another state I can't remember (New Hampshire?) chose to allow and regulate filming of porn.\n\nI wonder why the same didn't happen for prostitution though. I'm not aware of any SC ruling pertaining to prostitution. That's the case if organized prostitution is legal (brothels, prostitution clubs, etc.). But by limiting what's legal into \"private\" prostitution (direct client-prostitute transactions), these European countries were able to afford the right of persons to use their bodies however they see fit, while making it hard for sex traffickers to organize underground prostitution businesses.

Under federal law, [tipped employees make *at least* minimum wage.](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs15.htm)\n\nThis functions on an hourly basis. Let's say minimum wage in your state is $7.25 and you earn a cash wage of $2.13/hr. Let's say you work an 8 hour shift and get a single $20 tip during your entire shift. For that hour, your total salary is $20 + $2.13 &gt; $7.25. For the other hours, your salary is $2.13 &lt; $7.25. Oops, less than minimum wage - your employer is legally obligated to cover the difference. So they're $7.25 for the remaining hours. This yields an effective salary for the day of $9.11 / hour. Not too shabby!\n\nHow accurate is this little thought experiment? Evidently, not bad at all. According to the bureau of labor statistics, as of May 2012, [the median salary for waiters/waitresses is almost $9/hr.](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/waiters-and-waitresses.htm#tab-5) As a matter of fact, according to the department of labor, *most* states demand tipped employees earn *above* federal minimum wage (in this case, state law takes precedence). A handful of states (seven of them) even pay you full *state* minimum wage (higher than federal) before your tips. An additional whopping 25 states require you be paid above state minimum wage (see [individual states for specifics](http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm)). The left most column is your minimum wage salary - the minimum salary you may earn as a tipped employee.\n\nOkay, going back to how the median salary is about $9 / hr. This might be based on claimed tips. Anyone who works as a server will tell you that they don't claim all their tips, which means that the effective median salary could be much larger. Let's assume your average waitress claims half their tips. Then this median salary, which is ~$2 + $7 in tips is actually $2 + $14 in tips, which is roughly $16/hour.\n\nSo, when I hear servers try to guilt trip me into tipping them, I get pissed off. My default mode of operation is not to tip. If I get good service and I feel they went out of their way to please me, I tip. Otherwise, I don't tip. \n\nIf your employer is *breaking the law* by not actually paying you your full wage (and only your cash wage), don't put the onus on your patrons to pay you. [You have a legitimate complaint, and you should follow through on it.](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ_tipsandgratuities.html) But no, I am not going to tip you for your manager breaking the law.\n\nNext time someone tells you it should be illegal to pay you $2.13 an hour. Tell them that it *is* illegal. I don't tip, and neither should you.\n\nEDIT: typos Amazon has a week long sale anyway during the week of Black Friday. You know, Cyber Monday and whatnot. They do get paid a living wage. In fact, they probably make more than you.

For that hour, your total salary is $20 + $2.13 &amp;gt; $7.25. For the other hours, your salary is $2.13 &amp;lt; $7.25. Oops, less than minimum wage - your employer is legally obligated to cover the difference. So they're $7.25 for the remaining hours. This yields an effective salary for the day of $9.11 / hour. Not too shabby!\n\n&gt;How accurate is this little thought experiment? Evidently, not bad at all. According to the bureau of labor statistics, as of May 2012, [the median salary for waiters/waitresses is almost $9/hr.](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/waiters-and-waitresses.htm#tab-5) As a matter of fact, according to the department of labor, *most* states demand tipped employees earn *above* federal minimum wage (in this case, state law takes precedence). A handful of states (seven of them) even pay you full *state* minimum wage (higher than federal) before your tips. An additional whopping 25 states require you be paid above state minimum wage (see [individual states for specifics](http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm)). The left most column is your minimum wage salary - the minimum salary you may earn as a tipped employee.\n\n&gt;Okay, going back to how the median salary is about $9 / hr. This might be based on claimed tips. Anyone who works as a server will tell you that they don't claim all their tips, which means that the effective median salary could be much larger. Let's assume your average waitress claims half their tips. Then this median salary, which is ~$2 + $7 in tips is actually $2 + $14 in tips, which is roughly $16/hour.\n\n&gt;So, when I hear servers try to guilt trip me into tipping them, I get pissed off. My default mode of operation is not to tip. If I get good service and I feel they went out of their way to please me, I tip. Otherwise, I don't tip. \n\n&gt;If your employer is *breaking the law* by not actually paying you your full wage (and only your cash wage), don't put the onus on your patrons to pay you. [You have a legitimate complaint, and you should follow through on it.](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/FAQ_tipsandgratuities.html) But no, I am not going to tip you for your manager breaking the law.\n\n&gt;Next time someone tells you it should be illegal to pay you $2.13 an hour. Tell them that it *is* illegal. I don't tip (unless the service is above and beyond the norm), and neither should you. ... what? In a culture that's built around tipping, not tipping will not stop that culture? I'm not following.  If you get fired for not being tipped, isn't that illegal? I don't know what servers want. The law is already heavily on their side. Excellent rebut, sir!  Excellent rebut! A tipped employee *always* makes a minimum of minimum wage. A tip can only *increase* that amount. Likewise, I make the amount I make. A tip can only increase what I made. Can I go around claiming everyone is an asshole if they don't tip me $5 when they see me because I think I'm handsome? Sounds like conjecture. Employers aren't obligated to earn tips. I believe the definition of a tipped employee is one who makes $30 a month in tips. If you can't make that much, then I really don't know how the law works at that stage. Maybe someone else can shed light on it. &gt; if they have a bad night they never went to their manager and asked them to make up the difference\n\nIsn't that the point of claiming tips? You claim tips to both your manager and the IRS. You're assuming that the FLSA functions globally on the entire shift. I recall reading that it functions on an hourly basis. Do you have a source declaring which one it is?\n\n&gt;The money pulled in throughout their weeks might equal out to be minimum wage, but you don't know that.\n\nI go based on statistics. According to the BLS, as I cited, the median salary is ~$9/hr. The lowest bracketed salary is about $7.79/hr. That $20 paycheck is likely your cash wage for an eight hour shift. I'm not going to dismiss statistics based on an anecdote. Even if the anecdote is correct, and you're making under minimum wage, that's illegal, and *verifiably illegal*. In that case, you sue your manager who is breaking the law. You don't guilt trip a patron who has broken a corrupted social contract revolving around tipping.\n\nWhat difference is it to me to pay $2 extra? Those nickels and dimes add up. What's $2 tipping? Hey, this beer is only $3 extra on this Friday night out. Hey, upgrading to combo meal is only $1 extra. Oh, look, this is only $2! Next you know, you're living paycheck to paycheck like an average American. I don't live paycheck to paycheck because I'm frugal and don't engage in this kind of logic. &gt; Just to point out, its not by hour though like your 20$ tip calculation. It will be (tips + wages)/hrs worked at the end of the shift.\n\nDo you have a source? I recall reading it was hour by hour. I'm not following which part of this is making me a total dick. Are you saying that the Fair Labor Standards Act is hogwash? Or that the Bureau of Labor Statistics &amp; the Department of Labor are sketchy sources? What part of my sources are incorrect? If none, then where is the leap in logic I've made from decent sources to awful logic? Thanks! Why?  If you're pulling in less than minimum wage, that's illegal. A fault of your manager, not of the patrons Well, our society also champions gender roles and says men should work and women are kinda powerless. Am I also a slave to these societal customs? Should I be a misogynist because my society tells me I should be? Let's say I'm in Iran, and it's customary to kill my daughter if she gets raped. Social custom. Should I do it? You say cheap, I say frugal. In a single instance, $2 is not a big deal. In multiple instances, multiple $2 payments add up. Let's say you have minute interactions like this three times a day, for an entire year. You're looking at roughly $2000 per year that you're spending. As I said, nickels and dimes add up. At this point, being \"cheap\" doesn't hold the same weight. I don't buy bus tickets and prefer to walk everywhere. This saves me $4 a day when I like to travel. I don't own a car. See, all these little savings add up quite a bit. You say \"it's just $2\", and I say that there are multiple instances of that which can cost thousands a year. And Americans wonder why they live paycheck to paycheck.\n\n&gt;You mention suing the employer. That's a great idea! I'm sure the server will have all the time in the world to manage a lawsuit now that they're unemployed since they're suing their employer. Not to mention the money a lawsuit costs, as well as finding a lawyer willing to go up against a probably corporate team of lawyers designed for suits like this. \n\nCut and dried. IRS records of making below minimum wage, and being fired for it? Lawyers will salivate. Have you heard of Pro Bono? Class action lawsuits? Yeah. Do that.\n\n&gt;And you can get information based on statistics all day, that's not how it is when you're working.\n\nAre you saying these statistics are made up?\n\n&gt;You don't declare tips hour to hour, you declare them at the end of your shift, which is when the computer averages tips per hour and figures out how to pay you come payday. That's how it works.\n\nSource? What law are these employers following? I want to know. Two cases. 1) the server is lying trying to get more money, and already makes great money, or 2) the server is legitimately struggling because their manager is breaking the law by paying only the cash wage and not covering the difference.\n\nCase 1). I refuse to be guilt tripped into loading their pockets even more deeply based on a lie, considering the fact they probably already make more than I do.\n\nCase 2). I will not be guilt tripped into rectifying the illegal action of a manager.  Nope, I'm outlying the only two cases that can exist for why servers demand tips. In my original post, I outlay how servers are legally required to be paid. This puts all tipped employees into two categories: the ones who already earn well, and continue guilt tripping you to earn even more; and the ones who are legitimately suffering from their manager breaking the law. In each case, I feel being guilt tripped as a patron is morally unacceptable. No, guilt tripping is all the replies I'm getting calling me an asshole for my default MO being not to tip, despite the fact I only tip when I receive *great* service. Do you have a source that I can *verify for myself*, without taking your word as law? I've provided sources.\n\n&gt;Statistics numbers are skewed all the time by whoever gives the numbers. Statistically we should all be living better lives. \n\nSo you're saying that my sources aren't reputable? &gt;Nobody making that little can afford a lawyer, so they're screwed.\n\nPro Bono.

It's a documentary, and when I first started watching it I thought it would be more about Columbine itself and the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but it actually became more of an evaluation of why there is so much gun violence in America compared to other countries--including countries with similar amounts of guns.  It may be a bit off-topic, but it was very well-done if you ever have the chance to watch it.  It's on Netflix right now.\n\n**Edit:** I had wrongly termed *Bowling for Columbine* as a documentary when it apparently falls more under \"op-ed piece.\"  I am not very familiar with the categorization and had called it such because Netflix did.

It's not anti-gun, exactly (the gentleman who made the documentary is a member of the NRA--National Rifle Association, and the documentary even points out that there are 10 million families in Canada and 7 million guns between them all, with 1% the annual gun violence of the US), but it takes a strong stance and says that America needs to evaluate our culture and how it affects our view of guns and violence.\n\nSpoiler: In the end, it points fingers mostly at the government/media's use of fear to control the public and steer them away from bigger, more pressing issues.\n\n**Edit:** I have been informed that it is not a documentary and falls more under \"op-ed\" piece.

Deleted it anyways and added new 1. Hi Matias. Long time no speak! lol. So i went to the move tutors at the battle resort and i improved my electric team Just a TINY bit. It's a bit difficult browsing there, as most of the changes you can make are pretty situational. So hard to decide if move a or b would be better for the team on the whole. the move or the situational idea i got? Sorry, can't right now. Maybe later. Was thinking of giga drain for either galvantula or eelektross. There were a few more i can't remember too. Was wondering which punch to give to megagross. Leaning towards ice. cyal8r Matias. Grass test!! Where does it say this? I thought he was bug elite. Oh, i looked but couldn't find it. I wonder why he took K99 out? Just thought you may want to know, i'm on my way to get the regi's in a min. lol. Good! Should be all the more reason for wanting you in his league tho. Be nice if he's gone for good tho, although i doubt it very much. Yep, google is your friend on pokemon games. Particularly if you don't know braille! Got regirock n regice, bishes! Caught regice in a great ball. \n#i'm2pro4uregis# That's because he's cyberstalking us! Tbh, i really think we have a case! GL on wreckin his league! lol. I am gonna think of good names for them all, then might just bust 'em out on a ffa, give everyone a giggle! tru .... :D Wow, the rng loved you at that moment. That's like a 0.0001%chance i think! They are gonna take names and kick ass! like it! Think registeel has the best bulk? Did you see the famous run on battle maison/tower/w/ever someone had in gen 4? They used a trick alakazam w/choice scarf then switched to a amnesia/curse/iron head registeel w/leftovers. In the end it was getting more back from lefties than the damage it was taking! That tactic took them into the late 100's i think. It was on youtube. My regice has a good name. Still thinkin of what i'm gonna call registeel. Was Chibi robo in gen 5! too long  :( You need to sort out your flair text, K99! It's crawling all over Jamies' on the almighty list! lol. too long again  :( . Registeel could be the scoop! :p Yep you could probably do something similar with regice. regiscoop Would certainly be hard to take down! Got registeel! Now i just need to wait until tomorrow to get reggigigas. Reggigigas? http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2rk374/something_somewhat_interesting_about_xatus_design/\n\nSign him up! yep, lol. breloominati. He's the new ground elite! Yep, i'm surprised it's not used much more. I agree with what he said. I've never had problems against greninja. I'm surprised Bowen hasn't got more link karma. He's always posting links. http://www.redbubble.com/people/flynebula/works/9036176-hitmonlee?grid_pos=7&amp;p=throw-pillow\n\nGoing for link karma, then! That was probably me! lol. It seems like every time you beat the e4 on ORAS you get another starter! Did anyone else rofl at the prof getting chased by his own wife? Or have i just got a weird sense of humour? It did make me laugh! How can he mistake his wife for a pokemon??!? Think i'm gonna go beat the e4 again to see if any more are given away! ok, yep i think you're right. Post the BV. I could try and help you decide. I swear trying to trade with yourself on gts is just like looking for a needle in a haystack! :( A few of us could've pored over it and helped you decide. k. Weird is good sometimes. The unexpected! Found it! Dialga is next! :) Metroid would be amazing on wii u! Gamepad scanning a-la zombi-u. ok, are you on now? ok, tomorrow, then. Just found a shiny doduo in a horde in safari zone! He's such a tool! Who got you banned? Could also be the reason he booted you from his league! Couldn't watch the BV, tho, unfortunately.    :( Tried twice. It said it couldn't find it. It was on ORAS, yes? It says video can't be found. yep didn't you wanna battle me, Vinny? yep You are not showing up as online! Think i have all the ORAS legendaries now. Was just thinking... if they made a mega regigigas with a different ability do people here think it would go straight to ubers? Shame you dunno who it was. I could've tried to bait them, then get them banned! Was thinking ou if not much of a stat boost, or a not-very-good ability/shallow movepool, or ubers if decent ability/movepool. np, gg, anyways. You wind too many people up, lol. Unless someone has it in for us, behind the scenes. I thought its movepool was a little shallow. Yep, gg. I don't come across too many malamars, lol. Toshiro is back on MV..... Who knows with him! That would be amazing! Good idea. rematch with your official team? lol, get yourself a magic bounce espeon, maybe a mega medicham, or use your m.meta? Slowbro and... idk.... starmie, actually you have quite a nice choice with psychic. oh, right. Ok, give me a shout when it's ready, then. Jamie had 1 in his psychic team. Dunno if it was magic guard, tho. I think it may depend on stat boosts/ability. Ok will check now. Hahahaha! Just watched it! Thought he was supposed to have a bulky team? Looool! oh, right. I did remember it, tho. I would prefer alakazam. Jamie may think differently tho. Wouldn't a sash be better for alakazam? Not bulky enough! lol. Cool. Didn't realise it could learn all those moves! Hey, K99. Forgot to ask before. Can i use a prankster thundurus in my team? ok, cool, thx. :D Found a nice 6iv one sitting in my boxes!  :D I have exactly the same problem so i feels ya. Although, it was me that broke mine. Tried to stuff a 2ds charger in there, in a hurry! planting trees ftw! Afternoon/morning everyone. Been trying to think of a megagross team. So far i've got..... megagross, sash galvantula, unaware clefable... and maaaybe latios. Was thinking of using a leech seed/stealth rock ferro but then half my team is weak to fire! Would be a good idea if i had a decent heatran. Air baloon best bet? Similar to the 1 Silver uses. Came from him i think. Seems to perform pretty well so far. Doesn't quite fit tho! Actually i like the idea of heatran. Think i'd go for air balloon tho. That 4x weakness! Think i use that set on my fighting team! Nice comment on my name on the almighty list! Funny enough, i would've asked for something like that if you'd asked! Also, do i need to tell you my mvp from my electric team for my flair? Or just my favourite member? I've thought about it and shiny eelektross pls. Or normal if shiny's a pain. thx. Witty or trollsy? I can try to help. Seems i'm lucky. I missed that time when all the flairs/texts were fucked up. Just seen mine and looks gooood! Time zones actually worked in my favour. Was asleep when those things went a little wonky. Morning/afternoon everyone. hmmmm, gimme a little while, i'll pm you something. Check your pm. If you don't like it... well hopefully you can use some of it. :} Didn't like it? Np, i tried   :{ Short and sweet? Np, well feel free to use 1 or 2 of the quotes if you feel they fit. That kinda rules out most of my ideas then! lol. I guess you can still use 3....2...1 fight tho. Or something about a dojo? not even effective tho! This league vs. his? ok, gotta see this! Didn't know it was his sub. Looks like we got a reaction, lol.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/PkmnMetagameCommunity/comments/2s3x5e/toshiro_disconnects/ lol yep.

Even tho it did its job... i'm gonna replace it with a sash. That was a really good close, intense match, All. Gg! Hi everyone! ?? Coolio! Joint 1st! ok, lol. Some of it is! Some is shit hole! Suppose it's the same everywhere, really tho! go on.... I would suggest changing the pokemon in the sidebar. It just spat in my face. Justin Bibarel. He has a habit of doing that. That is possibly true. It's a pretty small island. I live here and didn't know that! Pretty ignorant of my own geography! I only live about 25\u201330 miles from the coast but i know there's other places that are further. oh... ok, nah don't need the pm, lol. You are right, pretty disturbing tho! Yep, your island is even smaller! https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHiOAhAwgw\n\nBetter watch your backs on miiverse, dragma/breloominati. He's the one that Silver 6\u20130'd when he had a m.ray/primal kyogre in his team iirc. Why won't they give me my destiny knot in the contest hall!!! Don't they realise i have pokemon to breed? Beaten the bee-yutches 4 times now. They hardly ever wanna battle! I'm pretty useless in contests. I just used the pikachu they gave me with 4 cool moves. ok, i really am a beginner on contests tbh. I understand some of what you say but... yep i really don't understand the points system.  I thought you had to use moves of the type you enter. It's pretty annoying/confusing to me. Don't really like them either. Just wanna get the destiny knot/lucarionite but don't even know how to vs. Lisla. oh right. That explains a bit. Maybe i should read a guide. I only really want the 2 prizes tho. For some reason i'm blocked on that account you share with Ian, so i can't comment :( Finally i get my destiny knot. So i'm breeding......... Shroomishes! lol. Then i realised they need egg moves :( ohhhhh.... that's why! I can't even make posts on the ORAS cowmoonity now :( . Dunno why they changed it. Gonna play ORAS just for a minute on my spare 3ds just so i can comment on ORAS with that alt. https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHiOmn4Jhg\n\nWell, at least he's changing the name. https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHiOs1TfOw\n\nlol, looks like i was only supposed to use certain moves in that breloominati battle! rly? Small world. He made anti-breloominati post, then disappeared. Don't think he's much of a battler, more a shiny collector, i guess. Will be their only competitive poke then! The rules are much the same as they were before, with just a couple of minor modifications. Sorry, just don't understand all this hate. Also, i'm pretty sure hp got reinstated. Ditto isn't banned! Irdk where you got that from???? I suppose. ;{ It was probably from the time that Ian gave a few of the elites a peek at what was going on. Not sure if he unmodded/approved them before or after Kev insisted the rule was rewritten so as to allow ditto/unown. Basically the no legend rule was rewritten to say.. no unbreedable pokemon but then of course it didn't cover ditto/unown and meant phione was technically allowed. So it was rewritten (again) and simplified. Yep, sure looks nicer. The DE comin' along... slowly tho. How can you say this is lies if, by your own admission you are getting this information from the very same people i am referring to? By your own admission you haven't seen this so how can you possibly call it lies? Am sure it will be eventually. http://www.reddit.com/r/Omnipotent_League/comments/2rckm9/chat_post_2/cno9nuv?context=3\n\nI haven't seen any of this, i am only going by what others have told me. Yet i tell someone that has seen all of it... \"LIES!\"\n\n #Turtlelogic# Pretty sure he was banned from here when the downvoting took place. I agree. I would say Toshiro is much more likely suspect. Also, stalking? Kev's not the 1 who has made multiple alts, not just here but on miiverse too. I already know Kev has nothing against this league. Also, there are some incredibly sad people on reddit. I had a mate who's sub was absolutely RUINED by downvoters. They made alts and downvoted him for absolutely NO reason and wrecked his karma to such an extent that he gave up. :( Yep, i felt bad for him. All he was doing was posting some pretty incredible animal crossing glitch pix which afaik hadn't been even discovered before that. Some people are just so petty and jealous! yep, i got banned off the whole animal crossing subred because of it, lol. Mind you, the troll got a lifetime ban too. All he had to do was go back to 1 of his alts tho:( :D Yep, try anywhere else on reddit. Y'know this is quite a big place. Plenty of people to stalk here! ^has he gone?^    :) Anyone beaten the battle resort/stitchup super single, doubles etc. yet? I got to battle 42 on triples before it stitched me up and 31 on doubles. Does anyone want an egg moves drain punch, bullet seed, jolly, quick feet shroomish? (lol, breloominati confirmed.)  I have 1 spare  5iv -sp. atk. one, plus a few breeding rejects. Some are poison heal i think. Ok, well do you want my spare? I have a 5iv 1 ( - sp. atk.) lol, no, the opposite! I have spares! wow! My last shroomish egg was 6iv! Ech? Fair enough but i needed 1 for my grass mono. Really? Ice is best at the resort? Will bear that in mind. I would've thought 49 would be the worst place to take a break! Knowing how it loves to stop you in your tracks at the worst possible times! Congrats on beating the others, tho. Yep there's some weird movesets in there. Designed to throw you off guard, i'll bet.  Good time to change team, once you get to the chatelaine! I remember taking my m.kanga out for 1 of them, as they had all fighting types. Am pretty sure the 'having a life' line wasn't meant to cause offence. I think it was the sword trio. I think gengar worked pretty well against them, too. tru but i think it was taken out of context tbh. By saying he has a life i don't think he is implying others don't, i saw it merely as justification. Maybe he could have worded it better, so as not to cause offence, as i'm sure that wasn't its intended purpose. The inactivity part does seem a bit off tho. He has already stated he needs help to run the place but...yep he should be more active to make the league work, once up and running. I do think Pat has a point tho. There does seem to be a 'lynch mob mentality' on here and practically everything he says will be taken out of context imo.  I usually have something with eq in the middle and levitators/flying types either side. Or something that knows rock slide/dazzling gleam in the back, hopefully to be placed in the middle if needed/necessary. That sounds pretty viable. Obviously a few other variables to take into account tho. Yep and are also at an impressionable age, where just a couple of comments by a rabble rouser can lead to mass hysteria. I'm not saying Kev has been faultless, however, this whole situation has been blown up out of all proportion. Kev did make some sort of comment about 'babysitting' once before. However, he gave the most mature people, the most power for when he wasn't about before (note.. Teenelmo) and that didn't work out too well either. I guess the term \"you can't please all the people all the time\" springs to mind here. Another nice idea. Should breeze thru it but no doubt the AI will find a way to scupper you! Was thinking of the paraflinch/fusion hax, the attract hax, the freeze hax, all the stuff the AI seems to enjoy. Good stategy tho. Good luck! What's your NNID? Not sure i'm following your new account. I try my best not to but they still find a way to! nvm found you! lol. I actually was following you, anyway. Crazy as this sounds it might actually work! Given that there are elite vacancies at the DE and there are elite overlaps too, it might just work out that the \"new\" OL elites could actually fill the gaps. My only question tho... who would be champion? So, i would lose the most, tbh. I s'pose that would be fair, even tho i did \"earn\" it. Thru 18 gruelling sets of battles. Not sure if i could do that again! lol. Would be a bit unfair on Junito, too. :) thnx. true but i think he wanted a shot at being champ, even if he was procrastinating a little. I don't understand that. If it was someone solely from the DE's original proposal, then i could understand... but it was Turtles' and afaik, no-one from the DE has responded. Surely if that was the intention, then someone with the powers from both leagues would have just done it anyway? Or am i missing something? Tbh i don't think Kev would be conducive to an amalgamation of the leagues purely because of css plans. There would be much more important considerations. Did he even respond? Didn't know if he was interested or not. So the leagues aren't joining together? I'm in the dark about this. All i know about is the proposal, then loads of quotes popping up. True and fair enough. Tucker is a proper noob! You should see some of the stuff he says! Am gonna go n watch this now. Should be a nice 6\u20130 for you! :O hmmm, ok i was gonna use it for something but i guess i could ask you. Mind getting me a fake out buneary? Doesn't matter if 5ivs are a pain for you to get, i can use it to breed a 5iv one with my ditto when i get it back from you if that's ok? yep i have a 5iv 1 but missing attack. Fingers crossed i get the right iv's in the fake out 1 you breed for me. Do you have the fake out donor? Btw, the ditto will have a destiny knot. Leave it on the ditto, unless you want its jolly nature. If you do, give the destiny knot to the other donor parent but can you please remember to put the destiny knot on the ditto for when we trade back? Thnx. Javi on miiverse? Do you have a link? I'm ingame, wanna do the trade anyway? I don't need it back until later or tomorrow. ok but the ditto is ready for whenever you need it. You are welcome to borrow it now. ok, no hurry for it back tho. ok you can borrow it now and give it back when you are ready. i'm chubbybiddy, btw :} lol, sorry i was wrong the ditto is holding the everstone. If you don't want that nature, then swap the items around. Can u pls remember to put the everstone back on the ditto tho? Thnx. :D Sorry about the crits Brett! gg anyway. Shame about the crits. I got a bit lucky. You have a really good team! You would've probably won without the crits. :{ For matches against you? I got the luck you should've had, then. Beat him twice! Although on the 2nd match, he forfeited at 4\u20134, so he may have had a chance.  I think in grass v grass mono's, whoever defeats the other teams' m.venusaur wins. lol just caught a cherrim in a dive ball without taking any health off it. Was a misclick but worked! lol. He's critted you before a few times then? lol, he'll probably call me Mr. Hax or something now! Sorry, i forgot to say earlier, gg all! oh... ok, lol. Was surprised you forfeited. You still had 3 pokes left. https://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHiRNtkVSg\n\nI know most team dragma members are blocked but i thought you'd find this comment funny! The power of klefki! This is my klefki beating a megagross because he let it set up! lol.\n\n\nURWG WWWW WWXX H9XR That's the 1! yup, lol. Tru. Very few things beat a set-up klefki. Maybe an unaware quagsire? Or a few fire types. You should do a multi tourney again. We can shift places with them to take each others' weaknesses, lol. Kangaskhan can learn outrage??!!?  So mega, powerup punch, then double outrage! The horror! Or is that just too gimmicky? If i could take out a megagross i'm pretty sure it could handle a magnezone. Was thinking maybe megachard x/y or maybe flare blitz darmanitan? Bulky rotom h would probably be a problem. True in most cases but ghosts tho. Sucker punch is too unreliable against ghosts but yep fairies would be a problem. I'd have to wait until there were none left on the field. Situational i know but could be a good late game sweeping strat. Btw i was thinking of using this more as a battle resort tactic rather than online. yep and it already has in super singles, doubles and triples! That's why i thought i'd see what the potential of outrage was. Got up to 5 in super trebles before taking a break. The AI strategy so far seems to be to use curse. That actually suits me fine, as while they're cursing, they're causing no damage output to any of my team. Then i can just hit them with special attacks. I have used shadow claw on it before. I'm just experimenting with tutor moves, really. lol Actually you do have a point. The megagross i was battling didn't have eq. If it had, it may have been a different story. Sucker punch does have its uses. Just not very reliable against the ghosts in the resort. Yep, mine's pretty bulky too but not that much bulk in hp! Just testing my flair is still intact. Looks like i've missed quite the episode! Btw, i may be ignorant.... but what is an OC? So... it's like an rp? So why are these people suddenly being trolled? Looks that way but i've not really followed it. Well, hopefully it's over now. \u266a\u266a\u266a catchin' feebas\u266a\u266a\u266a Hi, Justifying. nah, humiliate him in battle! I think i can read that. Yeh, don't give him the satisfaction or time of day. He doesn't deserve to learn from us! Puts them in their place tho! lol. lol, i thought your spellcheck had gone haywire! He's gone now, anyway, before he got trounced, no doubt. Shame. It would've looked ye goode lol. I thought your spellcheck had made you write pidgin Shakespeare, lol. It's happened to him before, he probably saw it coming! \u203a:) We don't have to read Shakespeare over here! Hi. It seems feebas is still pretty tradeable. I found out about a couple of feebas \"hotspots\" last night. I went and caught 7. Have been trading them for what i need to fill my dex in literally minutes i have traded 5 for pokemon i needed. Only need a few now so i can get my oval charm for easier breeding! What you trying to say, Matias? lol. cryogonal pretty fast. Aden, if you are making an ice team, you should consider an avalugg with curse and avalanche. After a few curses, it is almost UNBREAKABLE! Hits hard with avalanche, too. Really? They are still pretty rare. I looked up where they were and it's pretty specific. You should catch a few, they are still pretty tradeable and will really help you fill your dex quickly. I suppose you can go back to where you got it and surf using dexnav. I recommend catching a few. Just use it as a specialised ice type? Idk its movepool. Obv. it learns ice moves. A few ice types seem to have shallow movepools. Although i believe articuno can learn water pulse in ORAS. Yep, i think i'm gonna go there now. I spent 10 mins near the rock last night and caught 7. You mean without the charm, or normally? Yep i think they breed pretty slow. You would be better off going to the hotspot and catching a bunch. Cool that you got super lucky! Encounter rate 5% apparently. defences bad too. Would probably need a sash. Looks like he's not gonna shaddap about it, Brett, lol. \n\nhttps://miiverse.nintendo.net/replies/AYMHAAACAAADVHiS5S8Yqw How come you don't go for psychic? Then you could have your m.slowbro flair? Or is it taken now? No, no, no. You've got me all wrong. I'm not questioning it, i'm just asking why you didn't go for psychic, knowing how much you like megabro and the flair. It does seem a little tough on Aden tho, as every type he goes for, there's pretty stiff competition. Can anyone help me trade my jirachi over to ORAS? Or lend me 1? Only for the pokedex, so i can get the oval charm. I'll trade it right back. Jirachi is available in ORAS? ok, lol. Was just gonna look it up! Np, if you can't get hold of your 3ds right now. Thnx. I can wait and i'll let you know if someone else helps me in the meantime. It's terrible! Fuckin' stalker! Yep you keep telling yourself that. Especially as you are the only 1 who cares. Especially #4 You mean the opinions of all your different personalities? No, only you can do that but tbh i don't think you are capable. Also, why would i leave? I'm an elite here. You, on the other hand are just an unhinged stalker. 1. Yep, if not by everyone.\n2. His league is shit.\n3. Agreed.\n4. Yep, defo think we have a case. oooh dear, did wittle Shawin not wike the way we pwayed with him? Looks like you're gonna need another alt to continue with your cyberstalking, bud. Not me! That is actually quite believable! Nope, anyone but you or any of your other personalities can challenge. I'm thinking he'll be most of them. Pretty sure he has no friends. His only \"friends\" usually turn out to be 1 of his personalities. Yep, it's pretty easy to make him show his true colours. Also, proof of his cyberstalking, considering i've never told him where i come from. Yep, see? You didn't even know, yet Toshiro did! I thought he was joking when he said that. Must really freak you out, being in the same school as...... that! I'm pretty sure he wouldn't go to the same school as you. That's just too coincidental... and if he's recently changed to go to your school, then... the stalking is real! Hi Matias! Grass test? Your talonflame is really bright! ok, thx. Will get on. Will trade it right back to you. \nFC is 5129 1175 1029 Added. Pikachu! lol. Will go ingame now. Ign Chubbybiddy btw. I'll just give you a random 'mon then i'll give u the jirachi back in min. Thnx!! Have full dex now! I did too! lol. I just wanted to make sure it appeared in dex. He probably meant test, so you can practice. I'm gonna try and breed one of those for you, as i loved Silvers' Jirachi idea! Yessss! I have the oval charm now! Thnx Ryan/Shnurg! Do you wanna borrow it while you have my ditto, Vinny? You can trade it back when you trade back the ditto if you like. I wasn't sure, so i did it, just to be on the safe side. I dunno if you can officially but you could help him to test his team, so he's more familiar with it. I wouldn't mind having a friendly battle with his team against my mono too. Will try and get 1 but i have to get my ditto back 1st. Let me know nature ev's etc and i'll try to breed 1 etc. thnx!! :) Oh yeh, key item, silly me! Not sure i'm allowed here. Officially i am at the DE, lol. No, just the revamp is taking forever. I'm in charge of recruitment of elites but idk who from here will come back when it's up and running. Sure to be at least a couple of elites short. Am i able to change my text flair? Did you get tested? Which type? If you passed then no, you're all good. thnx! testing! I've no idea but yep i think it's to do with the aesthetics. Ok, i'm head tester now, lol. I can test you later, if you'd like. I think things will be ready in next couple of days. lol. Song reference... kinda. np we have plenty of time! As you can probably tell, from the amount of time the revamp has taken. yep that part has been a long hard slog from what i can see! :) :( shame. I was looking forward to having you back as an elite! m.manectric (shiny), eelektross (shiny), thundurus-t, electivire, rotom-w (shiny) and galvantula. Looked on miiverse and couldn't find it. I remember the pain to get to master rank! https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHiGssFJkA\n\nAAA beat this dude 6\u20130 so he must be a pretty amazing battler! Hi. You must be the 1st person up, lol. Going by your posts, you only had 4 hours' sleep!  :O Someone's alt? I hate it when that happens! Especially when i'm wide awake. :O It doesn't work then? Yep, sometimes it's impossible to get back off. He also made a famous speech about \"kickin' ass and taking names\". I think this is what got him the rep as the hard-ass \"reggienator\" type character, lol. Theme of the day:- There is no theme of the day, lol. At the battle resort or can you find him somewhere to battle him regularly post-game? Only, i don't remember him having a gale wings talonflame. testing. oh... so there is something there then! I've not seen him around there but i'll have a look for him next time i'm there. lol Ah. That would explain it then. :) :( So, i'm just about sussing out secret bases. I have collected 5 flags :{. \nNow, how do i go about finding all your secret bases/inviting u all to mine? thnx! Yep, that's what he does. I refuse to battle him, as i don't think he deserves to learn from us. Although, perhaps it's more like plagiarism? Cooooolio! That's good to know. 20 flags now! Just a few more than me then! lol. How do i find your secret base? Where did you see that???? It's news to me!!! He will never even get the chance to try out and i'll make sure of that! NO HE'S NOT!!!!! Proof, Turtle, or it's a hoax. If it was true, then possibly, yes. Not sure if Jamie's gonna come back as psychic or not :{ lol, no i've no probs with Vinny! oh yh, undoubtedly. Didn't think he wanted to come back to the DE tbh but i kept psychic open, just in case. Ohhhh.... that explains it! lol. Good work, you just averted a mini-riot! Phew! I'm glad it was a misunderstanding. I thought there was something i didn't know about then! Think that's the best thing atm.... because he may get a bit aggrieved if i look for a replacement, right under his nose. Then when the DE opens, we can cross that bridge when we come to it. You are probably right atm. Dunno if he will change his mind tho. I'm gonna keep the spot open even if there's only the tiniest chance of him coming back tbh. ok thnx and yep, you can have it back again when you need it. Did you get my fake out lopunny tho? Yep don't worry. I'll breed for jolly. Hopefully i'll get the ivs i want much quicker this time! The iast 1 i bred was a pain! Anything decent there, apart from the latios, tho? lol, you wouldn't get many visitors! ok, i'm looking forward to getting the eon ticket now. lol, true. He's banned now too tho. Missed most of it. All i saw were a load of deleted posts. I remember his name from before for something. Pretty sure it's not the 1st time he's caused trouble! ok.... and love the terminology for your internet, lol. I can imagine just which word you are thinking of! 4 dogs. 1 to hold the ladder. 1 to eat the bananas, 1 to eat the apples and 1 to change the bulb. These seperior/emboar etc. codes, are they for powersaves or are they to download the pokemon thru normal means? I may just use the set of the week \u2192\nif so. ooh, i'll have to download those then! Finally got my 50 streak in battle maison, in super doubles. Only after a mammoth battle around 47-ish, when it became a stall war between my klefki and a latias. Luckily i had maxed the pp for each move! I made it struggle itself to death, with the help of a few draining kisses i'd saved. Wally didn't have his talonflame, tho. He had a mega gallade. Managed to beat his team with my grass mono i happened to have as my team, lol. oh, right. That's how it works. Got to get my other 4 trophies. Idk how to use a \"friends\" team in multi tho. Only May, Steven Stone etc.'s teams show up in the options. Afaik, it hasn't been confirmed for any console, tho. Oh, i thought you could have a \"representative\" for anyone on your fl but they don't seem to be an option. So... yep think i may just choose Stephen. ok, cool, actually Nee, just told me too! Thx anyway. ah, ok, thx. Steven Stone it is then. Fingers crossed then. I have tekken for the wii u. It's pretty good. Only cost me \u00a36 too! I postponed after a couple of battles anyway. I think he did lead with his aero tho. So i'm not trusted then? It has to be 2 people to test someone if they don't have full permissions? Am i reading this right? Sooo... did Adens' game corrupt because of powersaves, or is it too much of a touchy subject rn? np, just let me know when you are ready. lol, looks like it worked.... too well! So i can test people to be elites? Cool. Ok, then.

Post teh fookin link! Don't tell me what to do! Damn right it is He added the jk later kek Sableye gets Counter  Oh my god Sableye gets Mean Look\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what you're saying is:When it comes to Choiced Non-Fire Physical Attackers, I can Burn them,use Torment so they can't do jack shit to me, prevent them from switching out with Mean Look, and let Burn Damage kill them? It's not gonna be the mega, I want to have Priority for Sableye's first move to burn the opponent so it won't take much damage and because I need to have the opponent use a move to torment them, and then torment them. If only Mean Look worked before switching I kinda wish Sableye wasn't Ghost type so the opponent would just struggle them self to death Wh-what? Unless I Mean Look first but then you got stuff like U-Turn and I'm Taunt weak although I guess that's one hell of a reason to not get taunted Oh my god... Hey can someone test this set out for me? I'd do it myself but OU is kinda ech Good, yes, good... Good. Yes, good... No. Do you wanna test my Sableye set on Showdown? I'd do it myself, but OU is kinda ech to me Idfk, take any team you have that already has Sableye and change the sets a bit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXcJgie6m-4 :/ All the keks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-jCCphTlpk First World Problems If you were in an alternate universe, you wouldn't be having those problems How does that fucker walk? Furthermore, how does he run? So today I got my PSAT scores in a booklet. I decided to staple the booklet so that I would never know what I got on it, it could be very good, average, or very bad, and I'm okay with not knowing Unoriginality FTW Why do people think saying that they EV trained their team is like some big deal? To a Miiverse dipshit, that may seem impressive but to a competitive player that's just basic My Tyranitar is also called Godzilla The average score for most people in my class were not g8 m8  I think I've arrived to a point where all KH music sounds the same to me I'll never know m8 and I'm gr8 with that I bet some dipshit is gonna go,\"Oh that thing must be Rock/Dragon!\"  Good 4 you Ayy if you want something that's wonderful,enchanting yet powerful, look no further https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcBNxuKZyN4 Eh, I either did good or bad. I like to think I did just fine, but I'd hate to open the booklet and find I was horribly wrong Just wondering, how many of you guys have Japanese related music such as music from anime as your theme?  Ask him what's the first thing he needs to do before he can be able to capture pokemon. Answer:Enter a battle with them Is it made in Japan? So if you're in a city, go to your items,select a pokeball,and then you just capture a pokemon? First thing to be even able to catch it would be entering a battle When you enter a battle with a wild pokemon, that's when you're able to make attempts at catching it. Selecting a pokeball and using it would be the actual attempts at catching the pokemon. And you gotta work on your whole,\"I am and will always have to be right!\" I know you never said you said that, but that's the impression I'm getting Next Pokemon Set of the Week should be Breloom imo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GZM6t6jU8k ...Ok? Ayyyyy somebody better answer the phone. Because I fucking called it! Ah. But it is weekly Yeah uh-huh, sure What's your Raikou holding? Does it only block status moves? I mean, you can't use Toxic on a sub, right? I dunno who I should pick up:Mr Game and Watch or King Dedede Ah ...No as in you can or can't? Playing Mr. Game and Watch feels weird, he feels like floaty yet chopy  Yup yup kek Do you have smash 3ds? Please? I wanna test a character without dealing with the usually For Glory sheet No ...PornoGraphy?  Oh yeah I'll just go and buy one with the stacks of money I have, thanks for your advice. I dunno what I'd do without you Oh really? Then go away Your fooking face Yeah, great comeback  Will you change it back? K Considering regular Regigigas is only low tier because of its ability, yeah Which brings a nice paradox:Jenny \"plays VGC\" yet Regigigas is her favorite pokemon And I know you may do something along the lines of *Jarry, but I'm not doing that, it seems kinda wrong I think it's Regigigas because iirc she said something about how that was her sister's favorite pokemon but then she died so it would be her favorite in honor of her sister Well what? I wanna see what the DE looks like. Why does Kev have to be butthurt about us? Not always I haven't played Showdown UU in awhile so I decided to play a match. Long story short, first match the guy had an Assault Vest Florges. I think I'm gonna take a break from UU for awhile Get out Well yeah, it depends a lot on whether or not the actual set is good by itself Why do people change when they get big in YT? ayy laugh ass my off Modest Choice Specs OP Bold Calm Mind OP Ayy laugh ass my off I'm too busy laughing ass my off lamo lamo DE TEAM UP AGAINST OL KUHFERMED Ayy lamo I feel like we're gonna be all Nappy about it and overuse it until it isn't funny anymore\n\n\n\n\n\nAyy lamo **LAMO** Ayy lamo Ikr?

Dane change it to stock\n I thought it would go down like this:Say the person uses Swords Dance. Contrary changes it to minus two, Defiant changes that to +3,Contary changes that to -4,etc. Ah...but if it didn't... Ah. See? I'm learning every day Dane, are you okay? When I said +3, I meant the actual value it's being increased by not the end result if that made any sense Uh...I didn't know that it got buffed?  Mom came home, sorry gtg gg The damn team builder didn't update yet Ayy lamo What? That moment you refresh the page over and over hoping to see something new Damn right it is UU I fink Where's Ty,Junito.and Brett? kek Garbodor is the only pokemon in BL4 You thought:GAWN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut Silver was like\n\n\n\"Nah, son\" Wanna 1v1? I wanna practice with Malcom X List of gaming consoles most used for watching porn\n\n\n\n\n\n1)Xbox\n\n2)Playstation\n\n3)Wii\n\n4)Ps vista\n\n\n5)Nintendo 3ds Nevermind Nah son, gtg eat soon Ty I think for the study, they combined systems like Xbox would include Xbox360 + Xbox One, but the study was pretty vague. Don't ask how I know that I don't know what you're talking about I blame ReviewTechUSA Dem comments tho https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dABo_DCIdpM I think your hand has seen more \"gameplay\" than your Vita Anything Goes I think he meant AG Hey, what's watching porn on the 3ds like? Oh Because I'm subscribed to ReviewTechUSA Marth be going all in with his tip if you catch my drift I wonder why we don't have many girls here but then I look at what we post sometimes  Wanna 1v1 in smash? I don't know how semester grades are for you guys but for me, they combine your first 2 marking period grades with your exam grade and that's your semester grade. I found out that if you have two A's for the first two marking periods, if you at least get a C (which is a 70) on the exam, you'd get an A for the semester. Their weight scale is broken af You have like the strictest mom evah It's alright, I just wanna test out my Malcom X K It's ok, I'ma play Black Ty instead Nope 5198-2553-2573 So are we gonna 1v1 or... I think I'm gonna make Malcom X one of my mains Alright I think I found out what I wanted to know, thanks Itachi and GG Eh, sure. Gimme a sec to add you Ready I need to learn some kill moves with Malcom X Then let him join Mr. Game and Watch Oh he taunted. Yeah okay Alright lunch time. GG Black Ty  What are they? Pit? This is why I call you Black Ty Meh Meh Mr. Game and Watch has a \"grab combo\" that I think does 20-30 damage LIKE A BITCH Fucking broken, bruh Your face hoe? You have a face hoe? Not you. Him Did you see the video where he got Falcon Punched three times? Ayy lamo Sure Oh he taunted. Yeah okay Can you pick somebody else, please? I imagine yours since you disconnected and not me Yeah hold on Itachi Okay I'm good. Itachi join and I'll watch I didn't know you would just do the same combo  Probably not  Turtle, you wait for the watchers to sd Maybe if you had more tricks up your sleeve than just that combo, you'd have had a better chance of winning kek Oh and @Silver:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af2ZwDIwHZQ With your Ness atm, you better not be Itachi, why don't you grab the mini-Koopas? I'm not giving advice or anything, I'm genuinely asking I said atm meaning your Ness right now is not very good. All he has going for him is that combo and his grab kill move. You need to work on the other aspects of Ness if you want better chances of winning with him. But this is just my opinion Damn right it is If Pikachu and Luigi both let their side get fully charged and hit each other, what would happen? Don't worry, your Ness will get better. You should probably work on recovering for starters \"Don't roll, kids\" ~DAMAGE You beat me once.... You beat Itachi once.... Hey, I'm trying to give some friendly advice so you can get better Also, given the fact that you sd like three times trying to recover, you should probably take my advice That moment you talk shit and can't back it up *lamo ...Does that count as bragging over nothing? Oh don't beat yourself up and quit, just keep trying, bruh I've answered that question before In my mind, I called what gif that was I'm gonna call that you are/were gonna reply with the thumbs up gif \"I didn't know you were gonna go for the same combo over and over\"~ I believe it was something along those lines and what do you mean by \"shit like that\"? Ayy lamo Ayy lamo He should call you maybe I have never told you you sucked prior to today  ...What? \"This is why I don't 1v1 you\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have never 1v1 you before today\" DOCTOR IS TEH MASTER KUFERMED It's like a fucking goldmine...  He said \"This is why\" meaning he had to have 1v1 me before, yet he said he never has Imagine if he said \"Bitch\" at the end of that taunt It's a paradox Wait hold on, you're saying I said you suck (which I don't think I did) yet you yourself said you suck at smash, so why do you even care? In fact, shouldn't you be all,\"I don't even care\"? Isn't that how you deal with insults? See this is what I'm talking about when I said deep down you don't even how to deal with things anymore Tru dat, especially in Mario Kart Read the posts and replies above and below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cRrcgzqjv0 28:34\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did he do that? I'm not trying to  Yeah that's what he said, but how exactly? kewl, thanks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_2OPd25FOw\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly shit. That was beautiful and deep. Wow Pokemon FFA? How did you come across that picture? What did you type in? And like, why? I think it's you,Bowen,and AAA Get Out\n\n\n\n\n\nNah I'm kidding For advice? Ah. I'm pretty sure the only person here that at least 1 person doesn't trust is Itachi I'll ask again:FFA, anybody? Wynaut? Shnurg and AAA aren't Sure Forget it I forgot about this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvwMtWkfkJ8\n\n\n\n\n\nAh, a place for all the Frozen haters to say how much they hate it and act like they're the only one who does Yeah because of that one song which made it extremely popular. Then since it was so popular, people assumed its popularity was proportionate to its quality so people went to see, saw it wasn't as good as people made it out to be (but given how much it was built up, how could it? No movie could, let alone a kids' movie) so they all complained about how overrated it was and/or maybe people just hate it because it's popular Not really No What if I don't keep it pg14? Did Game Theory hook some of you guys onto to Matthew Santoro? Hipster  It's fucking bullshit because I like the movie but everywhere I look, I see people trashing it for no good reason https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGWOMDaDLoo Fuck you, any teacher that any person has ever had I should probably study for my exams but then again, I can get a C on it and still have an A as my semester grade so idrgaf Continue seeing them even though I know it's bad for me Once upon a time Those were the days... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLRTd4Delvg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+All teh respect  ~~Your mom up the ass~~ Eh, Smogon *facepalm* I wanna see it Awwwwwwwww Sure What does the subreddit look like? It seems pretty normal to me Me thinking in my head:\"Hmmmmm....I could say 21, 42, 69, or 9001. Decisions decisions...\" CURSE YOU, DUBSTEP!! YOU KILLED MY FAVORITE SONG!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIJLnTHvpHk Yeah cuz fuck sleep I take it back, I think the band did it first https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPswK2ebJvM Move a-la, move a-la, li la knowu do Can you make me a mod, pwease? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboZctrHfK8 He mocked it It's PU, right? Unless it got bumped up Why don't they allow Ditto? That's a stupid fucking way for them to inadvertently ban Ditto  So who's there, anyway? Ah \"Here at the Deadly Eighteen we only have like 5 people here\" http://i.imgur.com/OTxWXAs.gif Said no one ever Best title ever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq1CxY_HaYw Are you in the same battle? How does one know its infinite? But what if they don't Harvest? What if they get crits? Would it be infinite then? Bring a Trevenant  Call it 'Kev's gf'  I wish it got Harvest...oh wait it did and it's amazing Typical Smogonite Nappy isn't at the livestream If I had a dollar for every fucking 9 year old that does #______.... Banned from Ubers http://i.imgur.com/lScfxHd.jpg It's #insertstupidsomething or #blank Here's a riddle:One is white, one is black. There will be text on both, but the text can only be one color. What color will show up on both? That's what my Sableye ~~does~~ will do Ah but which works the best? When I see light green on white, I'm like:http://media.giphy.com/media/yhLV2DGTLDRCw/giphy.gif Speaking of which, can you just build a team with it and use it? I want you to use my Sableye in the OU tier and see how it performs. I'd do it myself, but OU is ech to me I'm not asking you Sableye @ Leftovers\nAbility: Prankster\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD\nBold Nature\n- Torment\n- Will-O-Wisp\n- Recover\n- Mean Look The idea is to have Sableye up against a Non-Fire Choiced Physical Attacker. What you do is Mean Look them so they can't switch out (unless of course U-turn), Torment them so they just Struggle themselves to death,Wil-o-wisp them so if and when they have to hit again you can use Torment on them, and Recover to stall. You could also use Rocky Helmet to be that much of a dick Because you don't care You mean like the DE subreddit? Farfetch'd gets an evolution  That's what happens to you Meriority momplex lamo Right which is why no physical pokemon has ever been burned by a Sableye I should know my cards before I play them? I just cringed so hard right now. Anyway, you shouldn't do it because you're just gonna bitch and cause problems about it so in regards to this:Fuck Off Because you're not the same as other people and vice versa Well then maybe they figure to get as much damage as possible, with this set you can kill them without getting any damage whatsoever  Because he primarily plays OU and Smogon while you don't...I think So can you please test it? kewl No....am I walking into a trap? What? Which is why I asked if you could make one OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! No you don't, shuddahp Nice flair https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRsPheErBj8 SO CAN I THEN WHY IS POINTING IT OUT IMPORTANT? kek The way it moves is funny to me WHY ISN'T IT NOT TO BE??? I know and it's funny to me Because why isn't it? No shit It's coming out of your mouth Gets OHKO'd by Chandelure ~~Took you three minutes to come up with that?~~ No, I never had shit come out of my mouth  When do I talk shit? ~~When I'm not impersonating you~~ All teh time, bruh It's not a very good impersonation tbh, I haven't mastered acting like I'm hot shit as much as you have I read that and all I see is 'shit' over and over again. Is it my computer screen? Nope. Are it my eyes? Nope. I guess you can't help from talking shit I can clone you what you need Maybe seeing your shit 24/7 made me crazy. I think you should stop talking just to be safe, don't wanna risk anyone's health Ok fine I'll breed for you. What do you need? ayy lamo Aww I appreciate the concern, but I'm good now ...Why do I feel like that's gonna be a pokemon's name in the future? You're saying my screen is actually talking to me? Oh you poor deranged thing Okay, give me until tomorrow-ish You just typed that it's actually happening. You didn't say I thought I was hearing it, you said I actually was hearing it Is it okay if I already have the evolved forms? There's no way of telling though. Even if a pokemon is bred, it still could have been modified. Unless you breed it yourself, you don't know what's modded and what's not. But even then, it's not that big of a deal. They can hardly damage your game I said or typed? ~~No, I'm gonna go to the trouble of evolving them but not making them battle ready~~ Yes According to you, if I'm deranged because I heard my screen talk, then so are you because you heard your screen talk. See? This is what happens when you start talking and there's shit everywhere, people go crazy You know how in how like,I dunno, cleaning commercials they say,\"Removes 99.9% of germs\"? It's because it's essentially 100% but they can't,by the smallest of percents, guarantee it Kinda like how 'talk' doesn't necessarily have to mean 'said' What does he sound like? Does he have one of those stereotypical gay accents or an actual one? EXTERMINATE THEM! heh Noob But define 'talk' Oh he said it? I thought said always meant talk. Huh. I guess you can say something without necessarily talking and I guess the opposite is also true. Thanks, K99 Ayyy There ya go I didn't....OR DID I? No, it's a sentence *gasps* Even you? *gasps* What's ya team? WHAT WILL IT BE?!!! Cynthia did it first Isn't her Garchomp female? Oh and  doesn't it have Rough Skin? So many jokes that can be made Show me  ...Couldn't you fight her in Gen 5 though? No, no we weren't No, no we weren't  Hey I am Normal\n You're a redneck phuck  He's not bad in FFA. oh and thanks for the combo I wish I could just stand near the edge like Aden does I feel like Ty and Aden are teaming up Well when you stay in one spot, people are gonna attack you  Aden basically just stands near the edge and edge guards I just learned how to dance with Kirby. GG, guys No you like lightly jiggle the control pad left and right quickly  Yesh...I think ? Been there, done that If you could buy me a Wii U and Smash U, sure Your loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNah, I'm kidding That means dick Holy shit. I don't know how to feel about this game \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZTQPTQovZA\n Goddammit, now I'm depressed  Then that means you suck at teambuilding I just watched a video of a guy playing this game, and the game was just...I dunno https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZTQPTQovZA It's really heavy, I guess It's not about you avoiding suicide since...Just watch Yeah cuz fuck STAB So you're the type of person to tell us to read something that we can literally just scroll down to see Did you finish it? Goddammit, if a game can make you feel attached and care about characters you know virtually nothing about, wow Watch the whole thing It's not just writing, it's the atmosphere and what's being limited to you It's not just writing, it's the atmosphere and what's being limited to you I'm saying it's not just the writing, everything needs to come together in a fantastic way Ayy next Death Battle will be Gaara (from Naruto) vs Toph (from Avatar the Last Airbender) and you know what that means? If any fan makes the slightest complaint if/when Gaara loses, they will instantly be labeled as a butthurt fanboy and will be made fun of by a majority of the people in the comments section. Damn, those people are gonna act like monsters making fun of some fans who may just have a small complaint ...Did you pick Lucario and he had Greninja? ...So what tier is Greninja in now? \"I like a death battle where I like both characters and don't care who wins or loses. \nAs for the next one, toph better win just to piss of the narutards.\ufeff\"~Actual comment\n\n\n\nSee? I called it, and it's already happening  I know, I just don't like the people who are so quick to make fun of people who wanted their anime character to win and are slightly upset. Those people can act like monsters Fun Fact:When asked about the addition of amiibos, Nintendo said,\"IT SHITS MONEY!!!! :D\" And Buu vs Kirby. So many people were like,\"You butthurt dbz fanboys are so pathetic\". It's true that some dbz fans were upset and got mad at Death Battle, but the amount of hate the dbz fans were getting was uncalled for  But if she's standing on sand, she can't 'see' Is your Goodra AV? So the appropriate response was for everybody else to act even worse towards the dbz fans? No, but that's how they acted and it was disgusting  Not the recent one, probably because I doubt anyone gave a fuck I c u showing off wit dat Hoopa Way I see it, the others are more at fault than the dbz fans Heh, you're Canadian I can't remember Heh, Canadians use 'U's a lot Yeah like Former mayor Rob Ford. Speaking of that whole honorable thing, how Canadians go to war? Yeah unlike you Canadians who put your milk in bags. Yeah, you guys got your shit figured out ~~How do you keep peace in a not so peaceful place~~  Ah.

Fuck dis sheet? Hey do you think Guts Flareon is viable in UU? How about on an Eeveelution team? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogPI690oPKE\n\n\n\n\n\n00:34-1:14 Fucking hilarious  Who? ~~Thought?~~ *checkmate* You just avoided creating a Creepypasta  *checkmate* I don't hate Kev, I just don't like his handling of the DE. He talks about how it's going places and it's gonna reach its true potential or some shit, yet he's rarely on because of other things. How is the DE gonna be this great thing if the creator is rarely on? If the answer is that other DE members will take responsibility then what does that say about a league that manages itself more than the creator does because he's rarely on because he 'has a life'. That too, what the fuck does he mean by that? Is he saying the people that actually care about his league enough to be active a lot don't have lives? Because if he is, he just dissed every one of his members. In fact, just show what he said to the DE subreddit. Back to the whole Kev not being active thing:You know what members of a league do when their leader is inactive? They leave and create a league of their own and the creator just goes,\"Eh fuck you guys, I'll find better people\" and then the whole thing happens again -9001 respect I do I think he did because if it was just an excuse as to why he isn't on a lot, he would of just said,\"I have a life\" and leave it at that. But instead he chose to tell us all the 'wonderful' things he's doing as opposed to those who stay active on reddit. But that's just me Well even before the teenelmo incident I felt like the DE was just sitting on its ass and not really doing much. Sure Kev was pumping a few videos every now and then, but then that's just it:Every now and then. The main problem I have with Kev and by extension his leadership of the DE is that he's not very good. Mainly because he isn't very active because he is a grown-up unlike most of us. He's not very good at handling problems because he isn't there to see it unfold and to try and stop it, instead he just comes randomly, see's a problem, and that just sort of gives him a headache. If he was more active, I'm sure less problems would occur just like if certain members of the DE weren't in the DE. Another thing though, since Kev handles things in a very piss poor way (imo) and other people giving him crap doesn't help so he handles them but in a piss poor way so then people give him crap about it and the whole thing cycles. I guess what I'm trying to say is that is that Kev was/is essentially going nowhere with the DE because he had/still has many things going on because that's expected when being a grown-up, I get that. However, to me, that still doesn't mean he doesn't handle the DE poorly. Yes he has an excuse but bottom line is that he handles it poorly. I don't want to follow someone who's rarely active and has a bad way of handling things imo ...A lot of us aren't grown-ups and tend to blow things out of proportion because that's how we are right now. That's not really an excuse but it is what it is. While a lot of use aren't adults, Kev is and his way of handling us is piss poor. Now you could make the analogy that Kev is essentially the grown-up parent and we're'/were essentially the kids and that any parent that has a group of kids causing problems and arguing, the parent is likely to be overwhelmed, that's understandable. However, if the parent was rarely active and just left the kids on their own, then that parent isn't a very good parent. Just like how a leader who rarely shows up isn't a very good leader &gt;\"You're a fucking nigger piece of shit who should die in a hole\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh that was just taken out of context, guys. Don't worry\n\n\n\n It's just an example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct65LxdxexE\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWXf77yRkBU\n\n\n\n\nThat's for your weird af Missingo episode\n ...You think the DE should be a team? Then why are you always,\"This is MY league.\" and why does it come across that all final decisions are made by you? And wait a minute, there shouldn't be any shitstorms or arguments? Really? You can't expect there to be none I just realized it's probably gonna take like 20 hours for Kev to reply to me lel ...Is nee going insane? I don't get it...I mean like I get what was happening, but how? After watching some clips of Naruto, does every anime follow the format of filler,some kick ass fighting, filler, some kick ass fighting, etc.? Also, I noticed the trend of Naruto in terms of flashbacks being that all of them are essentially:\"Let's see how this person's childhood was...Oh, it was shitty.\" You learned how to kill someone without much time/effort down to a science Spiking is like the lamest way to kill somebody  No, charging up a well timed smash attack is I don't like spiking people because that's just an unfair/lame way to kill someone imo You're lame To me, it is lame. It looks cool, yeah, but it's still kind of disrespectful to me. Spiking to me is saying that you're not gonna put any effort into killing the opponent, instead you're just gonna rush to throw them off the edge and spike them What about using Luigi's taunt to kill? I main Kirby,Sonic,and Mr. Game and Watch and I rarely even try to spike with them Yes, to me Jumping and doing one attack. Yep, not much effort Your point? I mean, yes there's a risk but that doesn't mean jumping and doing a move requires much effort Once Now you go,\"No, what I mean is that since there is a risk, the spiker has to put effort into not getting hit themselves and spiking the opponent\" Now I go,\"Well considering you're in the air, you're not using much effort to begin with as opposed to being on the stage where you have to move around,attack,shield,dodge.etc. When you're in the air, the only thing you have to worry about is getting back on to the stage. Anyway, when you're in mid-air *And now that I'm getting sick of this, I'll say* it's easier to dodge\" Then you go,\"If it's so easy to dodge in mid-air, why do people even get spiked? See, there's effort in terms of thinking when the opponent is going to dodge,dodging the opponent's attack,spiking, and trying to do all of that in an amount of time where you can get back on to the stage\" Now I go,\"Ah, I see what you're saying now. However, my opinion still stands\" Do you see my chain of replies where I'm doing this argument by myself? Wanna 1v1? Dammit, I spiked Oh right, I haz your pokes The reads! Gallade,Espeon,and Bronzong lamo I don't even know what happened kek I think I sprang and the angle you went made you hit the stage and you got stage spiked Idfk I didn't ev train all of them and they have the natures you wanted You rolled more than I sd JUST TAKE THE DAMN POKES Best way to die in smash ever Yes, when I get on, we trade God damn, I'm telling Vinny the pokes I bred for him are ready and he's like playing 20 questions Essentially hitting you with your own attack GG Dane Nah, you're good, just stop rolling so much and predict what your opponent is gonna do Gallade is holding his mega stone, hold up Those pokemon have a sweet tooth You roll a lot  No, I had to fucking breed most of them and you will goddamn take them with a smile I have powersaves, which btw, I couldn't use at all so you will take the Gallade and his name will stay as Jaques Stop rolling I studied my ass of for a test and I got a 490, barely missing passed-advanced. A friend of mine who hardly studied and does the minimal amount of work in class got passed advanced. Fucking bullshit Stop getting hit by it Because Gallade's female counterpart,Gardevoir, is loosely based off of Shakespearean work/characters (see the dex episode) In one of Shakespeare's plays,As You Like It, one of the characters is called Jaques. That and Jaques just sounds cool on a Gallade  Nope Fair point :) I really love using Mr.Game and Watch :) Why does Malcom X's spike only work within an x amount of time/frames when doing it? I don't try them, I watched shofu's For Glory run with him  He asked I don't and won't https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiKqsXrYyG8 Anyway, why does his spike work like that? 3:02-ish Yeah probably. I can't help it tho, it's like an instinct at this point. I'll try to tone it down a bit but it works (mostly) and it's not as bad as spiking imo Mr.Game and Watch *Can't tell if he means actual pole vaulting or if that's a smash term* Can you DI those? I don't do that tho. I use that attack on stage ...You can pole vault in monster hunter? Yeah. Why? I guess it's just weird hit box/momentum stuff that I'm too dumb to figure out Really? If I did, sorry. You can ask Dane, I had a bunch of matches with him earlier and I only used it on stage. I think I spiked him once on accident tho And they thought it was a mindless button masher... Yeah but that doesn't send you straight down at like 0 percent as opposed to spiking Damn, shofu was wrong I figured To the lab! Fine, I'll stop doing it I take it back. fuck you. I don't give a damn anymore. If I spike or if you spike me, oh well, it happens. Do what you gotta do to win. If someone rolls a lot, oh well. If someone spams, oh well. I'll still be upset about those things but fuck it. And if I/we can't find ways of getting around those things, then that's on me/us If I don't like being spiked, I should learn how to dodge, it's my fault. If you don't like getting hit by Kirby's down smash, learn how to dodge or move  1v1? 5198-2553-2573 I'm accepting that I do that right now. I'm acknowledging my faults. You on the other hand don't. You're so cocky and so relentless in arguments always trying to get the last word. You have always have to say something back, you always have to try and 1-up the other person, you always have to be better than the other person Thank you, I will Ready? You know what? Fuck it. Keep rolling all you want. If someone predicts your roll constantly and punishes you for it, that's your fault and hopefully you'll learn to stop doing it THEN LET'S FOOKING DO IT! I know it's not news that you're a piece of shit but I can't help but type that because it's the only way I can explain the thoughts that are going through my head every time I see the way you act and how high and mighty you think you are Ready? Yesh So lag, are you done now? That's why nobody likes Lilat System and the F-Zero stage lel No, you get your ass back, Itachi xD How long will it take? Cuz we gotta smash more, I'm not going out like that lel. First match, bit of lag but a fair loss, I got my ass beat. Second match, fair loss on your part. Third, I think I would of had it but some dick decided to make that F-Zero Omega stage not let you...you know. Fourth match, fair loss on my part. I will settle for a tie or better xD  Sure When I stand near the edge and duck, I'm waiting for the lag to die down It's not the real her Team smash? The real her would put a bunch of crap about her childhood and what pokemon means to her in her profile Team smash? Hey, if someone is lagging up the game and it's aggravating me, I would be a dick to ask them to leave, right? And so Link slayed his evil Toon Link counterpart in the Arena and was purified  No Greninja Kirby? Them not including a charger for the new 3ds? Chu-ching! Wanna team up next round and oh damn They're assuming everyone who is gonna buy the new 3ds already owns a 3ds or 2ds B-But, Greninja and Kirby... Who are you planning to sell to? Didn't realize how much I buffed Bowser's attack stat. Woops I love how Junito turns around when he throws the top. As if to say,\"Nah, I'm not gonna hit yo-SURPRISE, MOTHERFUCKER!\" Whoa... Ah dammit. Welp, better gather the Dragon Balls You upvote whore Itachi! 1v1? Not only do you turn around, but you slowly walk away Nah, I ain't going out like that! I thought my Kirby was good but I see this man's Kirby on stream. I'm just like,\"Damn..\" Dane 1v1? If only there were stages higher than SSJ... Somebody 1v1 me in smash D: Itachi, 1v1? It better be Sucker Punch And by that logic:But Faries tho Oh but you know the Battle Maison will eventually counter team you The soundtrack from Sonic? LIKE A BOSS Someone has Crunch over Knock Off on his Scrafty and Stone Edge over Rock Slide on his Darmanitian \n\n\n\n\nWat is dis? And he has Fly on his Talonflame It's on his Scrafty 1v1 in smash? Yeah let me fix that A shiny I doubt that's true  He didn't say you don't get ev's, he said they lower your ev's How do I Jab Cancel with Fox? It's when you order pizza while walking on-what the fuck do you think a Jab Cancel is? It's when you cancel your jabs Why doesn't Shino get more screen time? It allows you to to a variety of things that do more damage as opposed to what your regular jabs would do 1v1? Shut up, cliche anime villain Naruto Let me host LET ME HOST Welp, I guess there are no good people  I'm pretty sure Pat has annoyed at least one person in his life ...Are you really using Wendy's Wifi? We should keep track of what the big argument of the day is Welp, that sucks. Not gg's, Itachi Define it You've been telling YOUR definition,yes. But I'm asking for the actual one I'm not gonna Google it because I'm not using the word 'cyberbullying' every five seconds  PUSSYS! So is that what being bullied taught you? You learned that you need to ignore it, but that's just you. Other people can't/have trouble ignoring it. And besides, if you know what's it's like, why do you seem so not-caring about it? It goes Siver,Junito,Me,then you I haven't battled you so I can't say Only one way to find out! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...Although if every time people play in smash, one beats the other, the other gets better and beats them, and then the whole thing just cycles over, what's the point in even having a ranking system if in like a few weeks the loser will become better and beat the winner? That only proves my point of you being a dumbass as of right now At rolling? Probably  Out the four people Itachi said, I ordered them But then those people will eventually get beaten by the people they beat and then those people will get beaten by the former one on top and the whole thing just goes back and forth Please don't type that, I'm allergic to bullshit  Probably Aroma Veil Mega Venusaur OP kek In In all seriousness tho, I'm pretty sure I'm better than you at smash I dunno, it's kinda like a paradox to me I'm nowhere near your mom They ban you for poor sportsmanship or something  I don't need other mains to beat you tho This statement is false But if it's false, that would make it true. But if was true, it wouldn't be false and therefore wouldn't be true and instead false. but if it was false, it would be true Nope, I haz Kirby,Sonic,and Mr.Game and Watch. I wanna pick up others but eh There ya go And Wario Itachi, 1v1? I have MegaLopunny to primarily hit Ghosts and Dark types Nevermind, your wifi is still shit atm 1v1? 1v1? ...Did I just spike with Kirby's Up B? Dafaq? Does that make us even, Itachi? You just mad cuz you got beat by it Fuck it, we're even then....Although I'm still better heh heh jk lel kek lol lamo 1v1 some more now/later? No Wanna 1v1 in smash? gr8 Even if it does, I doubt you can OHKO Mega Alakazam  Bowen, try dodging in mid-air Brave Bird I trust that since Aden is now trying for Ice, he lost GG Bowen Can you stick with Ganon? I wanna get my practice in GG Itachi Can we keep going? But I wanna kick Ganon's ass! Oh it is But that would be discouraging trading and helping each other out as friends. We wouldn't want that... Wanna 1v1 in smash? I mean... ~~Pussy~~ Ok, team smash when Dane comes on? Ok Anyone wanna team smash? Junito, you already know Damn, shit was going crazy I dunno it's like, should I turn team attack on or not? Me...shouldn't I? I mean, it seems fair but I dunno Ah damn. Sorry, Junito It would still be fair tho. Maybe Itachi would have been able to hit you and would allow you to recover  Who changed it back? aka Blues Brothers  Dane, you can join Team Smash Cuz Sanic First come, first served, bish But Blues Brothers! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI dunno, maybe Silver can replace one of you or something That's for damn sure BLUES BROTHERS, MUDAHFUCKA Silver,Junito,and Itachi, Team Smash? SONIC! The fastest thing alive! OOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKK Hopefully Itachi will get off his period in the meantime  Ok TOGETHER THEY MAKE... If anybody wants to team smash, just join Heh, you ate in a rush to be alone My Dick&gt;Your non-existent one  It's always that, ain't it? Ikr? I wanted it to be blue but noooooooooooo You don't know exactly what, but shit happened WOMBO COMBO!!! YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED FIRE EMBLEM AWAKENING YET????!!!! Yeah... Cuz Pit is white There, I changed to blue Can we turn team attack on for a few matches? ^ He like ran off the stage and didn't move quick enough to recover  You know he's spammy because that's why you turned off team attack. You know all you will do is spam and run all over the place (admittedly like me when I play as Sonic) because you know you will hit your partner. That's where the strategic part in team attack comes:Thinking twice before you make a move. And if I were to ko Junito or vice versa, that's how it is. That's team attack He racists towards blue people Dane 1v1 Ganon practice...please? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQg09j7hYmg\n\n\n\n\n\nYa know, when someone dies, all their shit gets released. So does that mean he's walking around with shit in his pants? I need Ganon practice And I lost twice against Ganon *Be a dick Shouldn't the pokemon set of the week be changed by now? *get rekt You dick Yeah uh-huh, sure I lost to Ganon twice with Kirby\n\n\n\n\n\nKirby is supposed to be great against heavy characters  I wanna figure out why Kirby has trouble with Ganon atm. Maybe it's just because Kirby is floaty around Ganon and Ganon has powerful smash attacks...I dunno I mean... Dumb ways to die... So many dumb ways to die... To be hhhoooooonest Welp, time to do some studying. GG guys I got the last Moo,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitch kek The fact that I quickly got like ,what, 30+ damage on you...Then again, I was at 90 something and had you have used that combo that every ZSS does, eh, I dunno Says the guy who sd trying to spike iirc from like 3 minutes ago Sure, sure kek OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH!!!! It's burning you up inside How'd ya guys do? What Attack would you replace that with? Not today, I haz to do some last minute studying  ...I don't know twice? You're one to talk But teh Ground pokes! Who? I would like to watch The concept does make some sense if you take in to account large and heavy foes  For today,Wednesday and Thursday, I get out of school at 10:40 cuz exams...yay Watch Nintendo go,\"April Fool's, bitch!\" That is not the black name I was expecting  Dayquan,Razique,Tymik,Cuantaveous,etc. KOBI! Could you imagine Duck Hunt Dog and Zelda on a team? They be making a mofoking fortress. Hardly ain't nobody gonna be able to come close to them Hey, if there can never be nothing (essentially, there will always be something) then what was here before The Big Bang? That's why I said,\"Hardly ain't\" as in not a lot kek, the first match yesterday, you and Junito picked Captain Falcon lel I was watching local news, and apparently there's a bar called 'Cock Island' We know, we fucking know Too bad you can't run Trick Room and Sand... I forgot to add \"...\" The people who decided were Smogonites  I know Silver's about to spike the shit out of me kek Then why did you exit out out the game? I could have just waited in the room... No charger tho/lazy? Yep I haz to work on air dodging  It's teh timing that's messing me up Does that mean like half of the Pokemon Let's Plays are finished? I wanna do a Team Battle BOP! Does that also include Shady's and Nappy's Gold and Silver ~~Versus-wait it's not a versus because their entire fan base has a lot of 9 year olds who take things too far and over react to every fucking thing~~ Let's Play? Aww Damn I know OOOOOOOOHHHHHH THE SPIKE! Teh salt iz real I wanna watch Then we shall wait until that time comes...\n\n\n\n\n\nNevermind Bruh LOL I'd commentate but that would mostly consist of me making smart-ass remarks about turtle repeatedly going for PK Fire to set up that combo I'm telling ya, white men can't jump Okay, I'm not gonna top that. GG, Silver And dat new controller doe It would make you mad so I won't do it Yeah. So how was I? (And it's not a \"Haha, I beat you thing\" because you have beaten me many more times and are far skilled than me, I'm just genuinely asking) My 3ds's Circle Pad is messed up, a lot of the time, I move it to the side to run and I just walk Sure, sure Ayyyyy, I'll take it Silver plays the pronoun game so people will have to ask who he's talking about **NO WAY!!** ...DP? They want to have a smooth Smash FFA, but noooooooooo, you just HAVE to be streaming  Dark Pit? Yep But back then... What's your FC? Mine is 5198-2553-2573 Just gotta keep practicing  *The opposing dumbasses fell for the taunt!* Or more so 'trap' but idgaf Wanna practice? I haven't... When people try to be hip This video has almost 4 million views https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSN-lS4bmGM\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's entertaining, yeah, but still, damn. There are people who put so much more effort and barely get 1000 views  You shallow mudafuka  Sure, sure Yesh. Wanna 1v1 for practice? Then let's practice and get better so you'll stop losing  It took him like a year before watching Frozen You don't fuck with Reggie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1NW1EL5X9Q Yep lel Mine was $24.99. Stupid Target... You're Game Theory's bitch So...nevah? Who has the most satisfying spike? Mario, Yoshi, or Ganon? Why do I have to take Spanish? Won't more people just have easy access to translator devices in the future? Welp, I'm fairly certain I tanked my Spanish exam I'd join but I'm rusty Wanna 1v1 in smash? That's the spirit! GG, AAA ~~What about like the 9 wins I got before that?~~ It was a fluke win imo mainly because I sd and you suicide killed me. You didn't actually give me a chance to fight back, instead you stripped me of any chance by killing me in like the doucheist way...But I suppose a win is a win and if you're okay with getting at least one win, that's perfectly okay Good for you Okay Really? Because I figure they do, especially for pokemon like Tyranitar  But most do so that means most of the time you're up against a Weavile, you won't have much to switch in on it But mostly, you'll lose against Weavile How do you plan to switch in on a Weavile? 1v1? Input lag... Then maybe you should turn off the items GG It's cool Uverse ...What? Oooooooooh, okay yeah now that makes much more sense than what I was thinking Ur a plushy You have until June 30th to redeem yourselves! Ur welcome  Didn't the creator of Meme Run get sued or something? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9RT22ZDQG0 I'm sure he liked it wet He liked the wet cock Ur eating fried chicken  The thighs and breast I mean...and the whole cock \"Good night guys. I'm gonna go and Hyper Beam my bed\"~I forgot who said that but it was funny as hell Fucking racists, man Double Meanings FTW Yep *Watermelon  Yeah, that's what happens when you lead with Sonic; the opponent loses all skill. Some people can't handle the speed of Sonic. It happens Ice Climbers weren't in because the 3ds couldn't handle both the player and cpu as one character yet we have Rosalina Yep Sonic is 6...wait a minute...SONIC 06 KUHFERMED...AGAIN That's what I said, basically Mario is a good character for people to start out with imo. He's easy to get good combos and spikes Do what JTails did to Diddy Kong I said they couldn't handle both as one character aka more stuff in the game Ur a beginner  Hey, it takes skill to do the same thing over and over and then back throw to kill... If I wanted a comeback, I'd wipe it off your mother's face Watevah Mr.Game and Watch is the answer to the universe Stop trying to always get the last word He doesn't suck, you just don't know how to play him Damn Why didn't you Fake Out to begin with? I know how to play him So was I Yesh I do Ah That has got to be the most generic excuse ever. You know, ya may be good, but that doesn't mean much if most of the time, you make up excuses whenever you lose. Some understandable while the rest are pathetic things you would give Aden crap for saying Well ,dipshit, your reply is an excuse because you gave an excuse as to why you lost. And I treat you the same way I'd treat my 2 year old cousin:I say the same things over and over in the hopes it will get through. Having said that, you ALWAYS give an excuse every time you lose. It's so rare to see you take a lost as a fair loss almost as if you're 'too good' to get beaten fairly. You rarely own up to any lost. If someone were to beat you ten times in a row, you'd have a shitty excuse for every one of them Right as you hit him, were you like,\"Aw damn...\"? Mr. Game and Watch is 42 :( Some dumbfuck  *gasps* I dunno. Just read the comments he made Maybe we're both that guy Ayyyyy good point You disgust me, you unforgiving monster... How am I biased? I'm just kidding That's like the only way to think/live Okay? Shocker How is that biased? 1.That's not what biased means 2.Again. that's like the only way to think/live. We do things,learn from those experiences, and make/live based on what previously happened. It's like the expression,\"It's our memories that make us who we are\" Anyway, I'm done talking to you in regards to this subject for now, but if you wanna reply, that's cool. If it'll make you think you got the last word and won the argument, good for you Ayy kek Wanna 1v1 in smash? Wow, I feel so dumb right now. I was watching SGK's Sonic and I couldn't figure out how she was able to cancel his spin dash because I assumed she was using his side B like I do. But as it turns out, she uses his down B to do it which I completely forgot existed so I never used it. Basically, it's faster than his side B but a wee bit harder to control  \"You have been disconnected for repeatedly targeting one player. Your local police station has been notified and will be dispatching an officer shortly.\" I'm bored so I'm gonna \"breed\" the entire UU tier Nintendo, take my money! Remember that one YouTuber that said the Wii U was the next Virtual Boy? Kek, dumbass. Then again, it was just a theory. A Game Theory Yeah but that goes for any new console. If you recall, the 3ds had very piss poor launch titles but look where it is now. This may sound stupid, but you can't make assumptions of a console based on the launch titles  Bullet=Dodged Does anybody happen to have an Absol with Zen Headbutt (kek) and Play Rough?  Shadow Tag shenanigans  I'm gonna make a mega one and a Super Luck one I could run Calm Mind Blissey.............but I won't CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! What like Aura Sphere? Focus Blast? Blissey can eat it ahp. And if it's a physical fighting move, why would I leave Blissey in on that? I could run Counter...but I won't Give me like 30 min. I'm in my bank trying to get any pokemon I can for the UU tier He's a hipster Ewwwww, Diancie is in UU ...No That's just a box to me Reasons why the Wii U is selling:Smash Bros.,Mario Kart 8,and Hyrule Warriors  Turns out, I only need like 20 pokemon to complete the UU tier It's Friday, I want my damn Apex Vlogs from poketubers Does anybody have a Seismic Toss Blissey? My fucks, count them _________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnahjkkeklellol I know, I know ...You can lower the level? Because that particular set gets rekt by the very recently popular MegaBeedrill Cool, thanks. Can you nickname it? MY B!TCH! I'm talking about in the UU tier Yes Is it ready? Does anybody have a Morning Sun Close Combat Arcanine? What are you looking for? Ayyyyyy I got an 88 on my Spanish exam I have the Chesnaught. I'm looking for \n\nArcanine @ Rocky Helmet\nAbility: Intimidate\nLevel: 50\nEVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Def\nImpish Nature\n- Morning Sun\n- Close Combat\n- Will-O-Wisp\n- Wild Charge I have the item My 3ds's Control Stick is screwed up I only have like 7 pokemon left to go Ayyyyy Dragalge,MegaHeatWaveandHuricaneUser,and Contrary Serperior are in RU suspect test Banned from RU Choice Specs STAB Adaptability Draco Meteor wrecks a whole lot of stuff in RU Wow, you just jinxed the shit out of that Nintendo is basically saying,\"Buy this if you don't wanna suck at smash\" I will Good One leleleleelelelelellelelelelelelelel Ayyyyyy, there ya go, AAA lelelelelel 50 Boss? They should really make it to where Ganon's side B doesn't take him over the edge if he misses  I'm just gonna watch now It amuses me seeing you guys trying to take care of Bowser Jr.  There was still a struggle on their part AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!!! Okey? I wanna Team Smash next Okey? GG, guys. AAA, ya getting better. Good job Tell it to the jury Lucario? Nope Silver,Itachi,Junito, do you wanna Team Smash? Fook it Nevermind, I'm just gonna work on completing the UU tier instead  He was expecting a Roost Ewwwww, generic VGC teams I can try Silver \"Because Grass-types are immune to Spore and Leech Seed, Fire-types like Heatran and Talonflame can be great teammates for taking them out. Also, Excadrill's typing lends itself to be an excellent teammate for Breloom as well, as it is immune to Poison and resists all of Breloom's weaknesses bar Fire. Finally, hazard setters like Skarmory or Landorus-T will force anything coming in to take a chunk of damage, and this is useful since Breloom will be forcing a lot of switches in order to shake off Leech Seed; Stealth Rock in particular is great for chipping away at Fire-types, especially the omnipresent Talonflame.\" We call that \"4/6th weak to Fairy\" I'm tired of beating yo bitch ass Does Heatran seem good? Immune to Poison, resists Fairy,Ice,and Flying U is trippin like fo reel, cuz Hello? MegaAltaria? Choice Specs Sylveon?  Bruh, u struggle against Malcom X and Kirby. You have to keep switching characters while I stick with the same and beat yo bitch ass Mega Altaria is OU, dumbass Welp, if Ty is joining then so will Aden Having trouble against just 2 with a group of like 5 is ech Kirby &gt; ZSS,Toon Link, Vilager, Falco, Sheik\n\n\n\nMalcom X &gt;  Vilager, Falco, Ganon, Lucina, Marth I checked the team builder, it says OU. I checked the set, it's tagged in OU Ya just gotta practice. We should 1v1 later Because he needed to be nerfed  Dat Eviolite Togetic FTW Then don't \"I don't use him, I just want to use him\"? That's how I feel in like every FFA all ever That really doesn't mean shit if you suck No fucking way Do you haz Juvia and Absol? You can play OR/AS on a DS? Whoa...  DS stands for Dual Screens, right? Alright so then 3ds is \"3 Dual Screens\"   I know it's called 3ds because it's the third one and 3d, but it still looks weird kek kek I just realized Itachi has to use the 3ds's crappy browser to use reddit  I'm surprised turtle doesn't use Bowser....Then again, he does use Bowser Jr. Everything that has ever happened or will happen is happening right now in that smash room I just said that like 9 minutes ago TY CAN ONLY WIN BY TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE KUHFERMED! Okey? God I love Ness's taunt U ain't no PIMPNITE *cough* Aden *cough* Was it, turtle? Was it really? ~~That and hope to Arceus your opponent doesn't set up hazards or have priority~~ I know, I was kidding DUDE, JOIN! OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!! WHERE ARE YOU AT, TY!!!!????? WHERE ARE YOU AT!!!!??? Shanks He doesn't choose, more or less he just battles random people and hopefully they're shit so he can pull it off Hit em up wit dat rest doe Kiss-ass Biggest fucking emphasis on \"try\" PUSSY! Well of course you're going to deny it, nobody's gonna go,\"Yeah I did it!\" No, not at all https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkZ_FF4GH8\n\n Nate's trying to act like Markiplier or Pewdiepie. Keep trying, kid. You'll get there LIKE A BOSS You're goddamn right....Although I like Jacksepticeye too, he's like the exact opposite of everything I hate about Nappy. He doesn't ask for likes at the start of the video, he doesn't label his fans, he seems actually grateful and means it when he says thanks (Unlike Nappy who does it for like 10 seconds), he doesn't annoy the shit out of me by saying the same shit over and over until it gets old, he doesn't go,\"Hashtag ______\" I have no idea how that happened... FUCK YOU!!!! Vinny is a fucking asshole Give me a warning first &gt;Dafuq is this game? Is this part of it? Cuz that appeared when I searched up images of it. The word \"this\" was a link to a pretty startling image I see them rolling, I hatin'. Even tho I do my fair share amount sometimes If you weren't expecting it, it was...For me, anyways ? GET FUCKED, TURTLE!!! At least I didn't get rekt when I died at like 77 percent when my opponent was at 135 Because bandwagon  turtle let Itachi in but not Ty? Nope LELELELELELELELLELELELLELEL kek I had it. No jumps left That's what happens when Team Attack is on, that's the challenge of working around it GG, bro ...Isn't calling him a stupid dumbass kinda redundant? kek 1v1? No Is it cheap? ...I do not understand that question Holy irony! K99 has to phrase his question like that so others will have to ask what the name is Ewww...is it white? So....It's okay to use him? I'm not cheap for using him? Hey, I'm not the one that called it \"SWALLOWED\" Ayyyyyyyyyyy WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO THINK WHEN YOU CALL IT \"SWALLOWED\"? Hey, Eviolite Golbat is surprisingly bulky GG, Nick Hentai?  Call it \"Bluejob\" We're smart I need a Shaymin, HA Crobat, and Jirachi...pwease help meh What? What's wrong with it? I literally told you that like 4 minutes ago Doesn't his attack get cut in half by being Burned? Do you got what I want? Oh...Well then why would any Physical Guts Pokemon not carry Flame Orb? I direct you to the same question I asked Jamie Then I can shinyfy your Servine Ah Yeah cuz you jinxed the shit out of that Do you haz them? &gt;Itachi can't win i have a megataria and a chansey with a garchomp as a final resort ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike 4 minutes ago But why Toxic Orb over Flame Orb? I haz Kingdra,Nidoqueen,Luc,Snorlax,and Trev GG, Nick Ayyyyy wat u want fo it? Oh and good job in the Team Smash Yup yup Shaymin,Jirachi, and Suicune kek Copy and Paste lel ...A what Jirachi? Your 3ds is silver. Nice \"Alright so we've shown that Killer Bee can kick Sasuke's bitch ass, how do we make it to where Killer Bee gets defeated?...Oh, I know! Let's give Sasuke this broken af move all of the sudden! Yeah, I'm smart! I know what will please the fans!\" It looked silver I love how we gradually  switched from smash to pokemon  ? Nevermind Already did I haz Manetric. I think you're forgetting something for Manectric, so if you are, I'm gonna let you figure it out Already did I know now Thats gr8 i r8 8/8 m8 If only Lucario had Mega Launcher in the actual metagame... I cloned that aswell Mega Launcher boosts the power of aura and pulse moves by 50%. In the case of Heal Pulse, it heals 75% of the target's maximum HP rather than the usual 50%. I'm talking about in VGC Good4u Hint:Fire and ______ YAS!!! YAS!!! Okey Xatu rekts in OU bruh Spell it right OOOOOHHHHHH!!!!! WHERE ARE YOU AT, ADEN???!!!! WHERE ARE YOU AT!!?? Oh...Well I said,\"Think\" so.... Was that everything? Ayyyyyyy shanks I haz one but it no has Curse and an Umbreon without Curse is not a good Umbreon Obvious question:Then why do you have it? Aren't you gonna use it? Blissey Did you also need a Kingdra? Metronome? Give it time SHEER COLD! Ikr?  Did anybody here need a Kingdra? Okey? He says ok A LOT SETTLE IT, IN SHOWDOWN!!! My Entei no haz ES so I guess I'll replace it with Flame Charge cuz fuck it Arcanine It's quicker and I can watch you guys battle live Sacred Fire? Fuck that, it's Extreme Speed that matters What nature? Because Sacred Fire is miles ahead better than Flare Blitz  That's not how it works, bruh. Think of it like Rock,Paper, Scissors  It's BL2 That's the same concept  But Liquid Ooze Sure ....Oh okey. Give me a minute to make the Curse Eevee. I'll max its friendship so you can just evolve it at night time Oh...well then you can just do that part ...Oh Manectric, it's ready It has 95 accuracy....Watch me miss like all of them. Anyway, the chance to Burn and stronger base power makes up for the small chance to miss as opposed to the recoil of Flair Blitz As a playable tier, yes. As a tier, BL2 If it's supposed to kill something, obviously the move with more base power is better Or just max the friendship with ps It's ready I wanna do it What do we need? Later We need 1 Sanic, 1 Captain Falcon, and 2 Lucarios\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1e6_9EKPZc I'm telling ya, black people are always late Dane, be blue We should get the Lucarios at high percent so their aura will be strong Now charge up your spheres in the middle  HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!! Now with a lighter character Duh GET FUCKED, JIGGLYPUFF!!! Dane... Or you... I'll be Lucario This is why I wan a stage like Balloon fight Let's try King Dedede he's light and big Let's try King Dedede he's light and big I wanna be Falcon next Pick FD Balloon fight He floats Are items off? I'm Falcon He's light in that sense I AM FALCON AND PICK A FD LIKE BALLOON FIGHT SO WHILE WE'RE PREPARING THE BLACK HOLE,WE WON\"T ACCIDENTALLY KILL THE LUCARIOS BECAUSE THE SUNS WILL ONLY COME AROUND ONCE There's no point in hitting the suns if the Lucarios aren't charging up their spheres at high percent Now who's who? COMMUNICATE, GUYS GET FUCKED, NESS!!! When we charge up our spheres, we should make it to where they line up so it just looks like one sphere forming Who's who next? OMG ITEMS WERE OFF Haz it Nothing stm Fuck it,let's go higher than 200% Whatever I'll be Falcon What if we had two reflectors and put either a sphere or sun in between them? We need to reflectors, and either two lucarios to put spheres in the middle or falcon to make the sun big and through it in the middle Have Falcon be on a different team than the reflectors So am I When you throw the sphere, jump out of the way Okay this time no suns Ty, throw your charged sphere at nisky, he captures it, and you both throw them in the middle You weren't throwing it in the middle and jumping out of the way turtle, if you're not gonna reflect gtfo BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT REFLECTING SO THEY'RE WAITING ON YOU Neither were you Turn time off When someone if firing the sphere, the other person should not stand in the middle like a fucking dipshit Okey, turtle is just standing there, someone replace him Until people can follow directions. I'm not even sure this is worth it anymore but we will try it Use Super scoops now Maybe we should all be on the same team I'd love to but our last fourth wouldn't reflect Turn scopes on Turn scopes on and nick be fox It goes out  Oh so they go out as well...Huh, didn't know that He thinks it sounds cool in his head His titles end in exclamation marks! \"Take good care of MY B!TCH!\"\n\n\n\n\nkek I can help with that No Wouldn't that be something? But if it was nothing then it would be something and not nothing...My brain hurts Nice variety in move types I believe you could go Moonlight over Wish. Also, if you're gonna go with Wish, don't ya kinda need Protect too? Would it be stupid of me to run Rocky Helmet Umbreon? In hindsight I probably should of evolved it before giving it to you Mang fuck Lefties if I Moonlight when I'm bulky as hell Latios? No, you said **A** clone. Pick one Whatever, I'm doing it my way...that and I already have a pokemon holding lefties I decided it to do it my way when I didn't like the advice I decided I wanted advice however the particular advice I got was not pleasing to me so I decided to disregard it and instead do it my way. Had it been advice I found pleasing, I would reconsider, possibly take it, and thank the person giving me advice I'll ask for advice if I goddamn want to and will disregard it if I want to. If that is counter productive, oh well. That's my way and I'm doing it my way. Thanks for the advice anyway Jirachi is the UU Togekiss I will ask for it if I want to YAS!!! .ti rof ksa t'nod nehT ? rkI\n\n Ask for what? Then don't ask for it No I'm pretty sure he's got you Ikr? Ikr? Ikr I beat yo bitch ass ffsdfsdfsf fsfdsfdsff Ask for what? ?tahw rof ksA Ayyyyyy I struck a chord. Noice. Anyway I've beaten you more times than you've beaten me Girafarig Girafarig U got me fucked up cuz Ur mum is ur sister Ur sister is ur mum Ur face is your ass Ur ass is ur face Ur gay Ur straight in denial in denial U toss salad  U toss salad  *cough* Me and Nick *cough* Turns out, I need a hell of a lot of pokes to complete RU Would Iron Defense Cofagrigus be viable? I think he's on the 3ds browser  Yesh an *its You said \"IDK do you think it would be good if Cofagrigus could up it's defense?\" It's is a contraction of 'it is' Spam lasers? I faced an annoying as hell Mega man on For Glory. He would run, turn around and do his A attack, keep running towards the edge, and if I got close to him he would run to the other side and do it all over again and I had Kirby Anybody wanna make a black hole?

The remarkable yet perfectly controllable energy contained in the thing in your hands awakens that part of your inner child that makes you say \"Whoa! That was awesome!\". There's just nothing like it. Also, target shooting is *incredibly* rewarding. You have instant gratification knowing how well you're shooting. Improving your marksmanship skills can be done quickly and noticed quickly with the right instruction. Also, the mechanics behind it. I love little machines. I love being able to completely take apart my 1911 and put it back together (successfully). It's like an Erector set. All-in-all, fun fun fun fun fun fun fun. Fun. Guns are fun. Just be safe. Like with anything in life. Depending on the substances that person is on, no. I've seen videos of guys walking right through pepper spray and being unfazed by a taser.\n\nMeth is a helluva drug, heh heh heh.\n\nAlso, there's an intimidation factor. Happened to a buddy at work. He was in Hartford CT, and he was parked on the side of a road, sitting in the drivers seat. Some guy came up and knocked on his window asking for something. He tried to wave the guy on. Asked him nicely to go away. The guy started getting aggressive. My buddy lifts his shirt a bit and flashes the concealed pistol at his hip. The guy vanishes. No harm, no violence. Neither is a guns. &gt;The primary use of a car is to get to point B, not killing/hurting someone. The primary use of a gun is to hurt or kill. \n\nWrong. Not getting into this debate right now. I'm relaxing drinking my coffee on a sunday morning. I will say this. There are countries with more guns per capita than the US. The problem isn't the availability of guns, it's the breeding of the criminal mindset. Taking guns away is a shitty bandage that does NOTHING to fix the actual problem. Restricting access to guns will restrict access for law abiding people. Criminals will still acquire firearms. Not getting into this debate right now. I'm relaxing drinking my coffee on a sunday morning.\n\nEdit: [Here ya go.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchrest_shooting) Firearms manufactures for a sole purpose of shooting at targets from a bench.

Some guns are not used for fun, or as \"toys\". Some are used for amusement and the owner might consider it a \"toy\". So what? Who cares? As long as they aren't hurting anyone and being safe, I don't give one shit. Some guys like to buy big tractors and dig up their yards for fun. But I'll bet that tractor wasn't design to be a toy, but here's this guy, having fun with it, safely. Really sad. People get so locked up in this box of thinking that guns are solely tools of violence, when that is totally and categorically incorrect. And I had to go to a class and get training to get my pistol permit. I am FOR skill-based assessment. You shouldn't be able to just go and buy a gun without any sort of permit of licensing. This is just common sense. What scares me is some states don't require such things, like Florida. There, you can just go and pick up a pistol. I don't like that. I'm not practicing to kill things. I'm practicing to hit the center of a target better because shooting targets is fun. Why can't you get that through your obviously thick skull? TARGET shooting is a fun to do activity.

I feel like half of everyone here who breeds doesnt look at their screen because they're doing something else, and one of these times, they're gonna hatch a shiny and not even notice it.  Ah, its fine. Im trying to hatch Weedles while waiting anyways. None of them ever have perfect Sp. Defense :/ YYup. Great hit and run pokemon. Wheres the Poison Jab?! Hope yer ready to battle my random-ass team, Brett :P Ferro, M-Gyarados, Azumarill, Klefki, Volcarona, and Sylveon. That paralysis didnt really matter. RNGesus loves me today :) Ill let your Lopunny see the true shrimp of horror before she dies. He had a Greninja. But it died XD Ah. Well, GG. I know that greninja wouldve taken down at least two of my pokes the moment it got in. Cant right now. Sumthin is muking up my internet. .-. Its been going on for almost an hour :/  I feel like the Lake Trio is a lot tougher to catch than they need to be :/ Azelf keeps breaking out without the Timer Ball even shaking. \n\nAnd its in the Red.\n\nAnd its paralyzed.\n\nThanks Obama :/ My internet has been acting like crap for the last few hours :/ ...does Netflix and Hulu Plus know some kinda dark secret about you? And you have to promote them so that no one else knows yer dark secret? The comment looked like itd be something a promoter for those guys would say is all :P I was just joking with ya. Simple, to teach you to not attack Cuccoo's. Thats why you dont attack them, even if its fun. .______________. Please tell me yer secret XD Welp, I muked up. I entered King's tourney on Miiverse. I didnt realize that Ubers (excluding the Primals) were allowed, and the only competitive Ubers I have are Zekrom and Aegislash .-. (And a few Uber Megas and potentially Greninja, but they are pretty much the BL of Ubers)  Try Hellsing Ultimate. That one's pretty fek'd up IMO. *inb4 2 notifications* I think he's worried about every match being a \"Who has the better Primal Team\" Match. Besides, are you ever on Ubers in Showdown? They're usage is so damn ridiculous! Just today, I LITERALLY couldnt go into a battle without the opponent having a Primal on their team! Its so much worse than Landorus-T in OU. Simply dont use Tyranitar/Hippowdon/Hippopotis. Problem solved. No one uses Tyranitar/Hippowdon/Hippopotis without a good reason. Ty sure loves his Stall teams. Ya know, this whole time, I completly forgot that Mega Ampharos existed. Mega Camerupt and Sableye are better Trick Room Megas, and its pretty much the worst Dragon Mega in the Game.\n\nIs this thing even UU anymore? Even after an Agility, it still cant outspeed Common Scarfers. Timid MegaAmph after an Agility: 414\n\nJolly Scarfchomp: 500\n\nAdamant Scarfchomp: 454 Also:\n\nTimid Scarf Heatran: 417\n\nAny Scarfer faster than that outspeeds MegaAmph after an Agility. And a LOT of scarfers are faster than that. The entire Toshiro incident was all a dream. We were never forced to move from Miiverse :P I had no school today because of a snowstorm. So Imma just spend time breeding. The Walking Dead: 1/10 too many zombies. I hate the Trick House's quiz...\n\n\"What Gender was Roxanne's Geodude?\"\n\n\"Were there more Men or Women in Dewford Hall?\"\n\n\"How many signs were there in Lilycove?\"\n\nI never payed attention to any of that .-. Too late. After 8 retrys, I got through it. Da hell? Petal Dance is a contact move? With Charge Beam. Yer gonna save the BV, right? Could ya leave a link to the place where ya got this??  I knew. But I mostly have my Mono-Ghost to thank for that.\n\nSpeaking of which, I really need to start remaking my Mono-Ghost :/ Mega Sableye is beckoning!  I couldnt find it :/ But still, I read that thread.\n\nThe guy's speech was probably very well thought out, but it still doesnt look good for Greninja from what I read... I really underestimated Mega Beedrill. He's incredible at hit-and-run. Imma prolly start using him more. A Choice Banded Aqua Jet from Azumarill cant OHKO Beedrill, so unless we're talking Choice Banded Scizor's Bullet Punch, it wont kill. MegaGross's Bullet Punch doesnt hit as hard as Choice Banded Scizor's, especially since most are Jolly. Then I've been rolling low the last 7 times ;_; Especially since it does more at Lv. 50... Oh. Stuff normally does a bit more damage at Lv.50, but I guess this isnt one of those scenarios. Cuz thats totally a thing. I feel like Mega Sableye is the only reason stall works so well nowadays. Tbh, stall really needed something like Mega Sableye, tho. Not that Im complaining, tho. I love how all my favorite pokemon are starting to become much more used .u. Meh. To me, it felt like Stall was starting to die out before ORAS. I think a defensive Magic Bouncer helped it out quite a bit...\n\nbut that's jut me. Stall uses it to beat Stall.\n\nStallception. \n#Over100TurnBattle I dunno. I was actually considering using a Modest Scarf Gengar on my Ghost Team just so I can beat Greninja. Cuz even if he DOES become banned, a ton of people will still use him on the cartridge. But I dont really guarantee that I'll kill the Greninja. It could change types and screw over my attack. And even if I try to D-Bond, I still go last, and the Greninja user can still switch out. But as I said, Greninja would be faster and could change its typing to something not weak. Ghosts fear the hell outta Greninja because none of them can switch in on him, and some of THOSE arent even checks. And losing a check to a misprediction would be fatal. \n\nAt least with Scarf Gengar, there's no way a Greninja would switch until its too late. I think the wind chill here is supposed to be about -20 or so. I hate Ohio. Ya'll know how Fairies are supposed to be a mysterious yet powerful force?\n\nI think [The 13th Reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czw-vDr9k-o) is a nice fit to this as a theme.\n\nOr maybe the [Remastered Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAwK5QPwQLw) would fit better? Any of the 13th's would work, tbh. I just like Reflection a bit better. Tyrantrum confirmed as a Rock/Dark type now.. lol ikr? I hate you for this XD Try Mysterious Figure in BBS. Seriously. Fuck that fight .-. Wait.....\n\nTHIS is the guy that kept me from using the name I want?!\n\nHe hasnt even been on Reddit in 5 years!\n Enjoy dying in that fight 30 times over.\n\nSeriously, he has absolutly no attack pattern, and pretty much one shots you with almost everything he can use. Didja forget to count any Doubles/Triples/Rotation/Little Cup sets that every single pokemon there is? Mono Fairy vs. Mono-Psychic .u. Wait, I thought you meant in-game .-. I cant get on showdown right now. Exactly. Go figure that out. I do .-. and pretty much everyone else here excluding a few others. so? Actually, Ive seen a ton of Drai Punch users, too. My school is closed today cuz of wind chill :)\n\nI feel lonely. Holy crap.\n\nI just got a Timid Contrary Snivy with Magical Leaf, Twister, Glare, and Mirror Coat over Wonder Trade.  Here is what the fight is gonna be:\n\n95% Using Dodge Roll\n\n4% You taking damage and attempting to heal\n\n1% Actually getting a chance to attack.\n\n Now I got a Adamant Poison Heal Drain Punch Shroomish, and a Calm Regenerator Audino with Heal Bell, Yawn, Encore, and Wish. \n\nI need to go on Wonder Trade more often. Ill check once Im done Wonder Trading, but it wont matter either way, as I'll rebreed it. Yeah, but at least this saves me from using BP. Its only missing Sp.Attack and Speed.....\n\nHP Fire confirmed. Never Mind. HP Water confirmed instead :( I thought I got an HP Fire Timid Contrary Snivy since it was only missing Sp. Attack and Speed.\n\nBut nope, it has to be missing Attack, too :( Ty said that he has the day off of school today, so idk. So... what kind of Serperior set should I go for? Note that breeding for Hidden Power Fire with 30 ivs in Attack, Sp.Attack, and Speed would be extremly tedious for me. :/ But if it IS necessary, I'd need someone to help me with that. Oh shoot, I accidently replied to yer comment :/ Ma bad. And yep, I learned that the hard way :/ I also learned that Taunt does, too. Yup. Trust me, it happened to my SubDance Altaria multiple times while she was behind a sub. Yup. I havent really tested Swagger to see if a Sub blocks it. Ok, thanks. \n\nBtw, I think I wanna use a more Offensive Serperior. Of course, Serperior has a shit movepool, so HP Fire is kinda necessary. But I cant breed Hidden Powers to save my life .-.  Yup. I really dont like relying on PSers too much, but there's no way in hell that I'll get the perfect IV's for HP Fire... I actually dont know all the PSers here. I know Silver and Jamie are. Arent you one, too? Ok. I need to level her up for Leaf Storm anyways. Even if it got got Magma Armor, itd go to Ubers. Regigigas already has quite the movepool, and is quite bulky, very strong, and decently fast. The only thing that holds him back is Slow Start. lel Really? It has a gargantuan movepool. It gets things like Thunder Wave, Swords Dance, Rock Polish, the Elemental Punches, Drain Punch/Superpower, Heavy Slam/Iron Head, Earthquake, Stone Edge, Knock Off, and Zen Headbutt.  So, my Offensive Serperior now has:\n\n-Leaf Storm\n\n-Giga Drain\n\n-Dragon Pulse\n\n-Glare\n\nI kinda need HP Fire. If I had to replace any of these moves, what would it be? I figured. I was thinking Glare would have some merit since it could paralyze Ground-types like Landorus or Garchomp. But I guess. Glare it is, I guess. Btw, can ya use yer saves yet? Yes I will :D Good point. k', Ill be waiting. Yup. If it werent for his ability, he'd definitly be Uber. Sorry, I was nicknaming my Serperior. Nah. Im fine with le non-shiny. I just noticed that everyone on my friends list in the PSS has an Ace Trainer as their avatar :/ Tru. :/ Are ya done with Serperior yet? k, I'll get back on. Oh hey, thanks for making him Lv.100 :) Hey, doesnt trading make a pokemon's happiness go away?\n\nOr does it return once it goes back to its owner? The internet completly shut off at our house for no damn reason :/ But its back now. Poor Ludicolo. So, ya know how during this month, there's a tier below PU called FU. Articuno is in it .-. I didnt think Articuno was THAT bad to have such low usage. I know. I just said that.\n\nI thought I saw a FU match that had Articuno in it. I coulda mistaken it for PU, tho. Well then...\n\nI think Shedinja DOES carry a good niche. It just sucks that the moves that its weak to are so common.\n\n School closed again. Hurray for the 4-day weekend .u. Then how about Heatran as a SR setter? Damn, these Contrary Snivy's must be in high demand. So far, two people offered me a shiny just for a Timid one :P Haha, sure. Ya got anything breedinng Leftovers or something to trade? I dunno...\n\nHow about I give ya one now, and I can ask for something later? And someone else just offered a Raikou XD ok. Tru. Ok. Just letting ya know, Im getting a bit low on them. Oh. Whoops. Ok, just wait a sec while I get a trade done. .-. I dont pay attention to anything XD Wait... Nisky just told me that Powersaves dont have Contrary Serperior yet. Is that true? Sure. I dont think I have your FC on my newer 3DS yet. My FC is 1177-9437-6570. That or Leftovers.  Cuz they all hate you. Ok. Actually, since ya have a Latios anyways, Ya dont really need the Balloon. You can still use it but just saying. Toshiro keeps DCing against me :/ k. I keep giving my FC to you, tho. 1177-9437-6570 I already had ya registered. Hang on, a few more peeps on Miiverse want a Contrary Snivy. One traded me a shiny Watchog, another traded me an Adamant HA Piplup with 4 Egg Moves, and another traded me a Raikou.\n\nTurns out that these Snivy are in high demand. Yup. It was officially released in Japan yesterday, and by luck, I got a Timid one in WT .u. Sure, but Im almost out. I can breed more by tomorrow if you wait. Of course. Like I told Turtle, Im just about out. You can wait until tomorrow, right? I personally use:\n\nLeaf Storm\n\nGiga Drain\n\nDragon Pulse\n\nHP Fire\n\nBut thats if ya want full Offense. You can, but probably stick to more defensive sets if ya wanna use Glare. That Megahorn against Haxorus was risky AF. I thought you would protect. Welp, thats what I get for over-predicting. It probably didnt matter, since MegaGross would just BP me to death. GG tho. Oh. well, Id have to hope for a crit with Drill Run, then. I didnt know there was a BL4 .-. Wait... he was too strong for PU, but not used enough for NU? Well, at least this shows that he is starting to get some actual use in NU. Welcome to the \"Toshiro DCs Against Us\"  Club. By the way, I found yer Secret Base.\n\nIts OP AF.  Why? I havent challenged anyone else yet. I turned Level Restrictions off and then proceded to get shrekt by yer Lv.100 Mega Lopunny .-. ...what? He brags about it to no end? And like the BM, he sure isnt afraid to break any clauses either *cough*evasion*cough* Watch, its gonna be revealed that his name is Bob. Damn, that sucks :( Sorry to hear.\n\nBtw, have you been on Miiverse recently? Its kinda being re-modeled into a Guild right now. Once everything is finished, we should be taking battle/breed/other requests by then. Prolly. Im sure Nin-Chan would want ya back. Ok, I have plenty of spare Contrary Timid Snivy now. I have plenty of Timid Contrary Snivy now. Ill 1v1 you I guess. I havent done Smash much lately, so I might suck XD k, but hang on a sec. This one girl wants a Snivy. btw, are we even friends on my newer 3DS? 1177-9437-6570 Welcome to ORAS .-. Ya stil up fer a match, or... k. Told ya I sucked XD Itachi wants to join. Like I told Alex, Im pretty bad at Smash :P Nah. Its just that I suck, and get ahead of myself when Im in the lead. You wanted a Contrary Snivy, right? Im ready to trade whenever you are. Lol Someone on Miiverse just offered me a Shiny Genesect for a Contrary Snivy XD Sure. Go online now. Whats yer IGN again? I cant access it, but is that my post? Well shit. The Shiny Genesect the guy gave me was competitive. Hasty Nature with\n\n-U-turn\n\n-T-Bolt\n\n-Ice Beam\n\n-Flamethrower\n\n6IVs, Full EVs in Speed and Sp. Attack, with 4 Atk EVs I already have a 5IV Adamant Zekrom, so maybe :P I dunno how to clone for shit :P I guess I could ask Silver. Sure. Im bored anyways. Whats yer IGN again? Yup. Hang on a sec, tho, cuz I gotta do a trade real quick. Uhhh... nope, not yet .-. give me a bit more time, ok? Maybe Ill see something I like in the FFA. Im pretty much ready since the person wont get on. AAA: 0\n\nToshiro: 3 Are we still doing this? ikr? cuz he's not at our skill :P\n\nHe also tries to counter-team every time he loses :/ His ScarfChomp accidently used Outrage on my Klefki, and DC'd as soon as the turn started Yup. Read K99's reply to my comment. He tells such an example. *Hatches Shiny Ralts*\n\n*Shiny Ralts is female* Yus. And fer Ghost, MegaEye. I did that before I saw this comment XD Said like a true Smogonite :P Ty just unintentionally reminded me that /r/smogoncirclejerk exists Now Im gonna use Trevenant on my Mono-Ghost team. I said that, too .u. Its just worded differently. Yer just upset that you found something else that counters Breloom .u. O rly? Fite me then. Its about time we re-matched anyways. We did once. It was when Team Dragma was way more well known, and quite some time before the Toshiro incident. I asked to battle you, and I barely won 1-0. I dont remember yer entire team. Its been about 8 or so months :/ But I think you had a Chansey. And maybe a Slowbro. Now Im gonna name something Omalyya JUST for you :D Naw. Its gonna be some random pokemon. :/ &gt;bai skrub frens\n\nSays the skrub thats never beaten me in a battle .u. Yew forgot Breloom. Doesnt mean I cant breed a Jolly Altaria .u.  Speed is very important, tho. Being able to outspeed things like Scarfed Heatran, and Speed Tieing with the likes of Dragonite is important, too. Sure. Get online. We're friends, right? Whatcha got? Im not really picky. I personally use Life Orb, but eh, they all have their charm. Uh, mine still has a symbol thing. Its fine. I said Jolly, so it would be a more Offensive set, so more than likely, itd have EQ.\n\nJust letting you know, I already have 3 different sets bred, so this wouldnt be very hard for me to make. Ugh, my right arm feels like it hurts. Yep. Prolly cuz I've been drawing all day, and I'm right-handed. ok, it IS hurting. Happy? I pretty much mean anything around Dragonite's speed tier. I also dont outspeed Weavile at +1 if I'm Adamant. And thatd be a feking horrible position to be in. Why is it that in Smash, whenever the AI is controlling a character that has a counter, they ALWAYS preform it at the perfect time 10 times per match??  Its like I could run up at them multiple times and wont attack, and they dont do anything. But the ONE time I try to attack, and they counter me perfectly. Thats some BS imo 1177-9437-6570 Im up fer an FFA. He used Greninja's secret move:\n\nHidden Power Fire FC: 1177-9437-6570\n\nIGN: Gilbert Both the teams Im bringing suck :P Allen, get ze fek online .-. Brett, FFA with us. I was trying to get Brett :( OK We need someone for the FFA. We already have Brett. Who else wants ta join? We need someone for the FFA. We already have Brett. Who else wants ta join? yey Ya still FFAing? We still need another person for the FFA :/ Anyone else wanna join? But we only need one more person :'( Cuz yer McDonalds internet feks everyone up .-. Yes you can. Git online. *korean guy\n\nYes, theres a difference. Oshawott's gonna put in so much work. This looks like a bad place for me :( What did Oshawott ever do? :( I wasnt even a threat... Guys, stop feking attacking me... I did absolutly nothing to any of you... just Allen.  Yeah, cuz its not like there was a damn Quagsire on the field or anything &gt;:( Serperior has 75/95/95 for defenses, so its bulkier than one would think a Grass Snake would be. It hasnt had enough time to be tested, tho. It wil definitly rise further than BL4 In my honest opinion, at the very least, I think Serperior will rise to BL2. If I remember right, Base 113 Speed is incredibly fast for RU standards, and all it really takes is 1 Leaf Storm to make any game GG. Remember, I said **at the very least**. Its entirely possible that Serperior ends up in UU. Welp, its official. Greninja got banned from OU. 2 actually. Low Kick was another factor in his ban. At least if there was no Low Kick, Empoleon would do a lot better at walling him.  Magnezone weighs 393 Ibs.\n\nSo no. Oh. \"Wait, is that a Mega Mawile he brought?! I cant believe he brought an Uber to-\n\nOh wait, Im using Greninja. nvm :(\" Welp, once again, I have no school, making this a 5-day weekend for me. ...unless? Blaziken didnt even need a Mega or Baton Pass to get banned before. It was also because of Speed Boost. Blaziken has excrllent offensive STABS and is very strong. It didnt need BP to get banned in the 5th gen. Why does every single legendary give me a hard time in this game? :( even Zekrom is being difficult to catch. Riiiiiight. I forgot Reshiram/Zekrom's catch rates were heavily reduced. Reminds me of the Goku vs. Superman death battle .-. I was personally rooting for Goku, but eh. Oh right. I was wanting Kirby to win that one .u. but yeah, I can agree with that. Every Death Battle seems to have some level of controversy. He has a niche in Ubers as a Poison Spikes setter, and functions as an effective Spinblocker and can stop setup and Defog with Taunt. He's actually more used than many of Arceus' formes. Wait, what was the most recent one? Finally got my Bold Sableye trained. Now to work on the rest o-\n\n*Sees sidebar*\n\n...... da fek? Cuz ya cant be as Tough as my Swampert. \n\nOr as Beautiful as my Altaria. \n\nOr as Cool as my Mightyena. \n\nOr as Clever as my Sableye. \n\nOr as Cute as my Linoone. Lemme share a secret with ya; dont have 4 moves of the same category. There are a lot of times where you dont wanna up the Appeal Meter. \n\nLemme tell ya, contests are like battles: ya gotta think about what you need to do, and even predict what yer opponents will do and try to capitalize on it. Im working towards doing that for ma shiny Altaria. You can use moves of a different type and they still earn you points. They just dont add to the Appeal Meter, which can be very helpful so that you make no one uses their Special Contest move other than you.  I think I remember this one FFA that Nappy had where he tried to make a Bibarel sound like the biggest threat .-. Mistakes were made. So theres this tier below PU called FU apparantly.I looked up a few pokemon in it.\n\nApparantly Luxray is in FU .-. Maybe it could turn into an actual tier. I think thats how PU came to exist. I think I figured out what I wanted.\n\nA Hasty/Naive Latios. Whats the guy's NNID so that I can look it up? It says that \"ClawstarXKouju\" couldnt be found. By luck, I found who you were talking about :P no, not that (although Id like to find that too :P) I found the guy who apparantly stole the \"Breloominati\" thing from ya'll. We should prolly get a few more peeps to join since we're public again. Hey guys, remember way back in the Mesezoic Era when I said I'd be hosting my Legends tourney? Well, Im starting ze registration on it now. Imma need help with some of the rules, tho. Yup. I did already. Im typing a few of ze rules out now. Welp, I gotz all of the rules done for my \"SPAM DA LEGENDZ!!!!!\" Tournament done. If you wanna register, go there. Also, if you have any questions about the rules, go to a seperate post of mine and ask there.,  Whats the NNID of the person that made the post? I wanna see it. Im fine with le HP Fire, but Im not sure if I want it shiny. But meh. Surprise me. For some pokemon, this is true. But I think this doesnt effect faster 'mons like Serperior. I think Silver/K99 said they unprivated this place. Oh khrp, yer right. I better fix that. Im not sure if I have that power. I never really ban anyone .-. Hey Kev. Do ya have a Contrary Serperior yet?  Pokemon Z confirmed. I cant find my 3DS! D: Yup. Bred it, too, and I have a few extras. Why do we HAVE to make it private? Getting downvoted by ONE person isnt the end of the world. Whats the point of us even trying to be a league if we just keep shutting everyone else out? We dont seem to be getting any lower than 0 anyways. This is no time to start jumping the gun and private us again. You act like one person is gonna single-handedly destroy the league just by downvoting. Dun worry, crisis averted. I found it .u. They dun get any lower than 0. As I told Jamie, its nothing to panic about. They dun get any lower than 0. As I told Jamie, its nothing to panic about. Im saying that the scores HERE havent gone below 0 yet, so no need to panic.\n\nAnd I already know that. Ive seen someones score in /r/pokemon go to -48 before. .u. .u. Just shows how happy I am. Im fighting Lugia, and I just realized that all of Lugia's moves only have 5 PP each...\n\nWhy, Gamefreak? Rain Dance, Aeroblast, Hydro Pump, Punishment Im fighting Suicune.\n\nI paralyzed it.\n\nIts at Red Health.\n\nI had 20 Timer Balls when the battle began.\n\nSuicune broke out of every single one of them... Speaking of Latios... Oh right. 1177-9437-6570. ok. Cant trade right now though. Freaking Suicune doesnt wanna be caught :/ k, caught him. Ill be on in a sec. lol thats actually the exact moveset I wanted on Latios. Thanks! No, cuz once you pick up the controller, you instantly rank in the top 100 for no reason. Da fek? That move better have a low Base Power to be able to do all that. Because then things get complicated. Sure, they could do that, but then peeps would start asking to ban things Regenerator and Sacred Fire on Ho-oh just for the sake of being OU, then this would lead to even more complex bans, and even MORE complex bans and everything will be feked up. ...thats like the best move in the game now .-.  I think its supposed to be a physical move.\n\nUnless yer joking. Hey guyz. I did a Mega Flygon build on Miiverse, and I could use some opinions on it. What Alpha said. I dunno if I was here for this, but... whats the teenelmo incident? Oh. I probably missed all of that because I had my XBox taken from me. I guess thats why I still dont understand why everyone split up. This is kinda what would happen. It would pretty much be a never-ending ban session. Many of the members of their community feel this way, too. MegaGross doesnt have Base 115 Speed either :/ its 110, like MeGallade. Wow. The Maison just straight up counter-teamed me .-. \n\nWatch this Battle Video and see for yourself:\n\nZYWW-WWWW-WWXX-BK8C  :( So, what would be better for a Kyurem/Kyurem-White? Timid or Modest? Cuz Im prolly using a Scarfer/Specs one. I think Ill go with Modest/Scarf. I think its still faster than Timid Base 80's like Chandelure and Altaria, so Ill still outspeed when they are at +1. By the way... do you have a Reshiram? M-Swampert is relevant. Rain Teams still exist, and I still see them quite a bit. Its fine if ya dont. I just need one to go catch Kyurem. I know there are, but Swampert IS UU, so of course there will still be some peeps using him. Really? I thought he was still UU. Anyways, it doesnt change the fact that, no matter how you look at it, Swampert still holds relevancy. Either way. Just cuz a pokemon isnt OU doesnt mean its not relevant in OU. You still see Quagsire around as a strong physical wall, and Chandelure as a good revenge-killer. Thats exactly why they are relevant. Of course things like Watchog arent gonna be relevant, so no one worries about it. But since Rain is still a thing in OU, you should still have something ready for Swampert. Yer right, what was I thinking?! Swampert is nothing compared to that monster! It has the almighty Hypnosis, too. Too broken. Must ban to AG. Catching legendaries takes a lot of time tho, especially since there are so many.\n\nBtw, theres also Secret Bases and Contests. Anyone here have a Reshiram and a Modest Syncronize Ralts? I need one because Im gonna try to catch Kyurem. /r/smogoncirclejerk Found a subreddit called /r/bravebird\n\nOnce again reminds me of /r/smogoncirclejerk I still need a Reshiram and Modest Synchronize Ralts. Anyone here have them? I just need one to catch Kyurem, since you apparantly need Reshiram and Zekrom in your party. I actually have a spare Zekrom. How about this: Ill trade you my Zekrom for... I dunno, something, so that you can catch Kyurem, and I'll let ya keep Zekrom. Once you do that, you could trade me your Reshiram for something, so that I could catch Kyurem. I wanna keep Reshiram, though. \n\nIs that fine? All right. Hang on, though, Im trying to catch Raikou. *Mamoswine Intensifies* *Thick Fat intensifies* Ya still here? I finally caught Raikou with good IVs. Im ready to trade whenever. If you guys fucking ban Woopkip, then Im done with ya'll  Im just letting you know, Woopkip is a good friend of mine. If you listen to Ty, Im not coming back until she gets unbanned. Actually, Vin makes a good point. I kinda like how they converted a community into one that focuses on OCs and RPs. Why do ya'll have to go mess with them? I dun care. I especially dont care about what you have to say, seeing as how you tried to get someone banned in the community just because \"You dont like them\".\n\nI already see ya'll ban a lot of people for no reason, too, and thats already bad enough as is. I dont even know who you're talking about. I feel like I heard of someone in a show named Shino, tho. Great comeback. Ya know what? Im in a battling mood right now.  oh. Yup, now I know who yer talking about.  Cant use showdown at home. If the shoe fits :/ Theres more than one reason people call it BS. She hasnt done anything wrong. If she suddenly gets bombarded with reports now, im pretty sure Itll be you guys. Its certainly not the first time you guys ganged up on someone and mass-reported them. Have you never heard of the expression: \"If the shoe fits, wear it\"? ...yer not being serious, are you? Well, you said that Vin said that trolls dont care about other people's feelings. Just take a good few good minutes to think about what you said. Good for you.\n\nThanks for proving Vin\"s point, btw. &gt;Hey you should tell Jamie to ban that girl named Woopkip who blocked you. I don't like her.\n\n:/ You would be directly involved in her ban. It might as well be you. Ya should. It worked for me.\n\nWait, Ralts? Ya dont happen to have a Modest Syncronize Ralts, do you? Ya ready to trade? &gt;Lucario: Mega Launcher\n\n*Specs/Nasty Plot Lucario intensifies* &gt;Samurott: Lightning Rod\n\n0.0 So much feking YES. and Dark Pulse. And Water Pulse. And Dragon Pulse.  &gt;Ducklett line: Gale Wings\n\nIs it relevant now?\n\nWait..... does this mean T-Flame will more than likely lose Gale Wings? Hey Silver. How about we \"battle\" real quick? I feel like having their confidence raise only for it to be torn down by you. Im bored .-. I was gonna pretend to battle you and get that James guy's confidence up for when he battles you. But eh. I dunno. Dam .-. Having played the Mono-type ladder some, I can confirm this. They allow Kyurem-White on Mono-Ice teams, just like how they let Aegislash in Mono-Ghost, and like how Talonflame is banned in Monotype. You must've never heard of Hyper Offense teams, have you? But its attacking movepool is abyssmal. Scarfed Kyurem. Never mind. Apparantly Kyurem isnt allowed... which is wierd, cuz in Monotype on Showdown, yer allowed to use all forms of Kyurem. But thats pretty much all it has. Ice Moves and Normal-type moves. Its Special Attack isnt even that high, either.\n\nThis is why I wish K99 would just allow Kyurem. Oh yeah, I did that a few times in Brawl. Good times. Its Defense is even worse than Mega Beedrill's defense. But its Sp. Defense is actually quite high. Still, it gets OHKOd b6 literally any priority not named Ice Shard Yer team gets wrecked by Claydol...\n\n*Implying that Claydol is relevant* I have a extra Slurpuff I still need a Reshiram, if ya wouldnt mind. ok. Do I have your FC? lol everyone, come to my latest post on Miiverse. Read the comments  I guess a genned one. Im gonna be needing some legendaries for my tourney anyways Guy: lol yer a noob fer this set.\n\n*Nearly gets swept 6-0, then DC's.*\n\nGuy: use a different team &gt;:(\n Ech. 252 SpA / 252 Spd / 4 SpD\n\nTimid Nature\n\nMoveset:\n\nBlue Flare\n\nFusion Flare\n\nDraco Meteor/Dragon Pulse\n\nSurprise me for the 4th move.\n Mega Fluffeh, Togekiss, Azumarill, Sylveon, Klefki, Slurpuff Thats fine. Just tell me whenever you're ready. Usually around the 1400's-1500's. I think my highest ladder score was 1547.  ok. Trust me, once you get that high, you start being forced to go into super-prediction mode. Eviolite Misdreavous tho. Its actually quite bulkier than Mismagius. I dunno if Marth could afford to lose that, but idk How can anyone just block Kirby's Inhale? It makes no logical sense. I thought you werent allowed to go after the same type as Aden. Or were they just joking? Im bored now. Anyone wanna FFA in ORAS? Jigglypuff, tho? Sure. Ill get online now. Of course. Bring whatever. Its always pretty much OU and below. Btw, my FC is 1177-9437-6570 if we arent friends yet. How is it AG? We're waiting on you -__- Wanna join us in the FFA. I might as well name yer pokemon while we wait. NOW we need 1 more. All left. Join our FFA instead. We need one more. We need one more for our FFA. Wanna join us? No one else responded yet. Ya wanna join our FFA? I dont either. I just have random trained pokemon :P :D btw, do I have yer friend code? Oh. Pat said he would join us. Ya mind waiting a bit? Fine. We dun need you anyways &gt;:( Ok. Mine is 1177-9437-6570 Should we start w/o you? IOf course. Just as we were about to FFA, NOW they're starting maintenance .-.  Me too. Gamefreak cancelled our FFA. Too late anyways. The server JUST started maintenance .-. Speaking of Golurk, I need o ne for my Mono-Ghost. Do you happen to have a Brave or Adamant Golett? Ah, ok. Ill ask him about getting one of the breeding leftovers, then. K99 says that yer Masudaing an Adamant Golurk. When the maintenance is ova, could ya give me one of the breeding lefties?? Wheneva you guys have room, I wanna join, even if I do suck :P lol its kinda true. At least compared to ya'll I think Imma scrub. *inb4 shofu 6-0's you anyways* Yer right.\n\nHe'll 7-0 you instead. Can I join? Of course Silver wins against me. He uses a Wii U while Im handicapped with a 3DS. THAT, and Im not that good. Tell me, have you tried playing Sm4ash on a 2DS? The handling is awkward AF. Ok. Still, Smash was not meant to be played on a 2DS... I knew it. Its bad enough on a 2DS as is :( Yeah they are. But you can only battle on Final Destination. Its still awkward for me. I have big hands :( inb4 yer Rotom gets deleted. Yeah. We have Sm4sh U at our school. We dont usually have enough controllers (Especially for 8-player smash) so some of us use our 3DS's. We have a Gamers club. We also have an XBox 360, XBox One, and a PS3. Some of us also bring in our N64's and PS2's and other stuff. I use Adamant. Im joining. Free wins for ya'll :P Holy Khrp, I won?! Da fek is Wally doing with a Life Orb Gale Wings Talonflame on his team?! By the way, my school called off just as I was about to leave :P At the battle resort. The second time you battle him there, his entire team is around Lv. 80. And its competitive AF. Exactly :P You need to get a 50-win streak in the Battle Maison first. Toshiro fucking copy-pasted my whole team &gt;:( My Mono-Fairy.\n He wanted to be Mono-Fairy before we banned him. Im in the process of it. His team is the same, but with different sets. Like CM Sylveon, and his Aromatherapy Slurpuff Shit. He got a crit. Now Im about to get swept -_____- He got a crit.... I pretty much just lost... Toshiro. Cuz I kept paralyzing him. I shouldve :/ But I can tell that he didnt save the BV. ok. I gave you an answer. Then you just said \"So?\" again. Im not playing that game. Im not going back. Yer just gonna rek me with yer Lv.100 Mega Lopunny again ;___; A while ago, yeah. I never battled ya since :P But now, once Shnrug gives me da Reshiram, Imma go catch Kyurem and sweep you with all three Unova Dragons &gt;:) But ya cant use all 6 of them on yer team. :'( Who wants to destroy me in Sm4sh? My team's 1 weakness D: That moment in Smash when yer attack is literally a pixel outta range .-. Eh. Im prolly done fer today. Tomorrow, perhaps? Damn. Well, I guess Friday? I wanna try to remake my Mono-Ghost like I've been meaning to. A moment that, through personal experience, seldom ever presents itself. Well, my mains include Mario, Kirby, Shulk, and Lucario, so other than Lucario sometimes, Im not really projectile-heavy. Huh. I found out something neat. If you have the Eon Ticket, then go to the Southern Island, as long as you dont try to catch the other Lati, you can go back to the Southern Island anytime. I know. But Im just saying. I already have a Latios, so Im fine. Apparantly /r/pokemon will be having a Tournament pretty soon on Showdown. Id join if I could even get access to Showdown outside of school. Sure. Prepare to win :P\n\nI made a room. Nah. But the music is bliss .u. Imma go there every time Im about to battle now. *sigh* I cant ever attack in the direction I need to attack in. Feking 2DS .-. Just like that. Doing my Side B when I know I did my Up B. How the hell did that happen? I just checked, and no items were turned on. I won a battle. And I loved the way I did it :P The other loses didnt even bother me afterwards. GG. No, its called \"Use a feking 3DS because you cant play it with an awkward 2DS with those big fingers.\" Like I said. Im not bothered by my loses. Thats literally the first time Ive been able to pull that off in Sm4sh. :/ Its not like Im gonna try to do that in every match. Sure. Ya on right now? Other than Megabro, yer team doesnt seem to like switching anything into Weavile. But eh, its still good nonetheless. True, but a lot of them have Low Kick. Just saying so that you keep yer eye on it. But you cant afford to switch in Chandelure, can you? The point me and Alex are trying to say is that Weavile pretty much gets a free kill every time it hits the field, especially since nothing on yer team resists Dark its fine. Whats yer IGN again? Ive got yours, too. Ill be on now. Thanks for le Reshiram. No prob. Yas . I got a Reshiram. Now...\n\nI still need a Modest Syncronize Ralts :/ Anyone have one? The GTS is super-unreliable for finding stuff like this. Not always. YUS! I found a Modest Syncronize Ralts! Now to finally go catch Kyurem! You were the one that said to get Modest .-. Nah brah. I wanna get a legit one. A while ago when I first mentioned that I was gonna used a Scarfed/Specs Kyurem. I also mentioned that I would sometimes fuse it with Reshiram in Ubers. Well, Im determined to use regular Kyurem at the very least. But crap... I dont have a Naive Ralts either :/ Oh, that'd be nice. I guess I can still use the Kyurem Im trying to catch exclusivly for fusion with Reshi. Ugh, I dunno what I could trade ya for it, though. Oh, thank ya :) Can ya trade right now or no? ok.  lol I used to use a bit of a gimmicky Mega Absol with Calm Mind, Dark Pulse, Flamethrower and Ice Beam Pidgey? Not Spearow? I said that he had it on your second battle against him. Re-battle him tomorrow and you'll see. Such an OU AF team. I dont see how it would stay considering that it hits harder than Latios, and has decent bulk. I guess Ill be on. There goes any hope of me winning any :P yey. Dat double kill tho .u. Thanks! Im starting to think Mario is becoming my new #1. But I still wanna get better with Lucario. Know anyone that would show me some techniques with him? Damn. He's been my #1 main since Brawl came out, but I never actually figured out how to truly use him. Im trying to get my Kyurem to like me more so that itll want Draco Meteor right now. But yeah, I should check out Youtube. Freaking Youtube didnt help me out with truly learning Lucario. :( I really wanna master him. Ive been using him since Brawl -__- But I just feel like theres something Im missing about him... Anyone have a Mold Breaker Drilbur/Excadrill? Tried to make them next-level plays by predicting you to Roost, maybe? Yet you still get 4-0'd according to all. Yer prediction means nothing now :P Meh. By the way, do you happen to have a Mold Breaker Excadrill/Drilbur?  Damn. Ah well. Thanks anyways. You can, but I just need one for breeding. Thats not necessary. I just want one so that I can breed it. If you can just hatch an egg and trade it to me, that'll be good enough. Its fine. Ya know, I wouldnt mind a Sm4sh FFA where we could use customized characters. Even Specs Latios cant 2HKO Chansey with Psyshock. You underestimate Chansey's bulk. Oh :P Are ya ready to trade that one of yer Kyurems yet? Yer team really seems to hate EQ. You have plenty of Steel, Poison, and Ice resists, so I think you could run Follow Me Togekiss instead of Amoonguss. ok. *Doesnt realize that Adaptability Close Combat was a reason MegaLuc was banned* *Doesnt realize that Victini is irrelevent to the conversation* Hey Ty. Im bored. Battle my random AF team. Every time I wanna battle ya, ya go off and do something else :/ but ech. Tomorrow, then. you had nothing to stop one of the most common OU pokemon in the game?\n\nSkrub. Yeah. But its only been a few minutes. Oh well. Luckily, Taunt doesnt affect Mirror Coat or Counter :P *Switches out to Unaware pokemon* Figures you'd be a Haxorus/MegaDos :/ Wut? .....still here? ok. I gotz anotha random AF team you can battle :P I find it hilarious that when I wreck someone with Shulk in For Glory, they switch their character to Shulk, and Id be able to tell that theyve never played as Shulk in their lives. Although, I think its a little more well built than my other random AF teams. I prolly have time for one. ok. Dun worry, I saw da other comments. Im too late anyways :P Hope yer ready to win. I had no idea Lickilicky got Oblivious. Not bad. GG Silver. That was close. Does it live a Banded Play Rough after SR and Sandstorm? Yup. VoltTurn would pretty much finish you off anyways. Anyways, how does my team look to you? Meh. Only if Exca is Sand Rush or Scarfed. Otherwise, Serperior handles it well. I also have Banded Azumarill to 2HKO with Aqua Jet. I can basically Check him pretty well, but not much in terms of countering. Yup. I forget how many EV's he has, but he reaches a Speed of 81 at Lv.  50 Oh. Well then. I only EV'd to outspeed uninvested Base 60's, and I thought T-tar was that Speed. But nope. Base 61. I dunno if I'll re-EV to Speed Creep T-Tar or not now. I wouldnt say its such OU. It's more UU-ish than it is OU. Even though Raikou and Beedrill are UU, and I know Serperior is RU or BL2. Even though Sableye IS OU, it used to be UU until it got a Mega.\n\nAt least I didnt bring a Landorus-T or Talonflame XD Whenever you get done, could ya trade da Kyurem? I do, actually. Toshiro didnt DC for once .O. I fought Toshiro twice and beat him both times.\n\nBattle 1: KWTW-WWWW-WWX5-5LCR\n\nI admit, I got a lotta hax against him in this one. But when I saw his other team, I didnt even care about the hax anymore\n\nBattle 2: HSKW-WWWW-WWX5-5LEK\n\nHe had the balls to actually bring a Salamence who could undoubtedly Mega Evolve. I honestly hate having to battle a team with MegaMence. That thing couldve prolly swept me if I gave him even ONE moment to safely switch him in. The Snaring Aura Sphere? That move is so fun to use in FFAs Rayquaza is 4x weak to Ice. lol", "topic_full": "cowboys right fuck just know football man play game did", "label": "TriplAAA", "topic_id": "topic_5", "topic_distr": [2.5853279626912599e-05, 2.5853207978541495e-05, 0.036538853152623764, 2.5853071199333936e-05, 2.5852788300037428e-05, 0.89787995562898726, 2.5852684588713367e-05, 0.06540022339062819, 2.5851254999814769e-05, 2.5851541067343331e-05], "mean_infl": 0.00034303260890525896}], ["AquaBuffalo", {"topic_repr": "fuck cowboys know", "text": " I used to shower every week when I was really young, I'm not sure if I was obviously dirty to others.

Two huge penalties and the bullshit overturning Amendola's catch that set up the Pats losing momentum in the first quarter.  Pats get all the calls though. Is Julian Edelman an elite QB? This is the most Cowboys way to start this game. Offense isn't moving, defense allows a quick TD, falls for trick plays, and can't stop the run.  Do we fade the flairs yet? I'm confused, Idhedigbo did something and there was no injury timeout? I think that McDonalds commercial gave me cancer. Buck and Aikman are the worst.  They get excited for every positive Cowboys play.  It's like CBS having Tommy Heinsohn do their NBA color commentary years ago. I think I just heard Buck and Aikman start a \"Let's go Cowboys!\" chant. Obvious PI right there, come on. I'd never think that the NFL would show blind favoritism to the Cowboys! Pick that flag up too, refs! This game is fixed. OPI to kill this drive incoming. This is like David Stern ordering the refs to rig a playoff game.

I really want the patriots to lose, but that was pretty good.  You deserve an upvote.  Hype just keeps building up.  I don't think it can be sustained for a few more minutes.  13 TDs / 0 INTs.  THAT is elite.  I was telling people that the Giants are gonna win the division next year.  Coughlin on the hot seat.  Healthy Cruz and beckham jr.  After the Giants won the division in the 2011 season, the order of division winners went Redskins, Eagles and Cowboys.  I would love to keep Michele Tafoya warm right now.  I'm gonna love the Ravens even more if they win.   That drive looked way too easy for the Ravens and I am loving it.  If the Ravens win, I can wait to hear all the excuses pats fans and the media will come up with for the Patriots.  I don't care about the result, it was a great challenge.   YES.  big momemtum shift for the ravens I know flacco I absolutely money in the postseason, but I didn't expect the offense to look this good early on.  Flacco is killing it right now.  Don't let the foot off the gas pedal.  It's not over until the clock hits zero in the 4th quarter That's what happens im when you leave Gronkowski open.  Damnit.  I fucking hate Roger Goodell Not Steve Smith.  Damnit That penalty on smith was complete bullshit.  Sit the fuck down Brady and watch Joe Flacco show you how to play in the postseason Yeah baby.  Keep on taunting.  I want Forsett to get like 150-200 rushing yards this game.  Damnit.  You need to get that fumble.  You can't leave gronkowski open like that.  Oh fuck  I want a subway sandwich with that chick.  This McDonald's commercial sucks Brady got picked off.  Please score here Ravens.  The story of amendola's tenure with the Patriots.  That touchdown was sick.  Flacco with 3 TDs in the first half.  He is on fire Ravens, please keep the foot on the gas pedal.  As a person who has seen a number of patriots games while living in boston, the patriots can turn it up at any time.  Play to win.  Don't play to not lose.  Can katy perry please have a wardrobe malfunction at the super bowl? She should just do the performance naked.  holy fuck.  I agree with you.  I thought you meant no wardrobe malfunction.  Read that too quickly.  I agree.  Has anybody noticed that none of those No More commercials have been played yet? Please just stop that.  They outplayed you in the first half and if they win, they played better.  Don't be one of the douche pats fans.  Damn. That deep ball didn't work.  Holy fuck. Deep ball on a 4th and 6. Ballsy as hell and I love it.  This defense that was supposedly the best since their super bowl run is getting destroyed by flacco.  I can't wait to hear the excuses from pats fans if the Ravens win.  The Ravens are outplaying you.  - Giants fan living in boston.  Joe flacco has 4 TD passes.  This is ridiculous.  I love it.  Since living in Boston, I'm always fascinated how pats fans come up with every excuse in the book whenever they lose.  They can't accept that they got outplayed.  Ravens, if you want to win the game, please stop Rob gronkowski.  Damnit harbaugh.  These McDonald's commercials are pissing me off Yes.  I love jinxes in this case.  I actually like the last two super bowl pics they showed.  Reminds me of the good times.  Damnit.  Fuck that shit.  Edelman probably has a better passer rating than brady.  Well Edelman has a playoff td, which GOATrapolo doesn't have.  PLEASE DONT MESS THIS UP RAVENS.  PLEASE DONT MESS THIS UP RAVENS.  Damnit.  Now flacco has a pick. He's on the decline.  Keep running the ball.  It's working.  Way to convert.  Now get a touchdown.  Forsett has been destroying this defense on the ground.  I really hope it's the 38-35 Ravens winning.  Looks like he's down.  Patriots catching a break.  Brady is way too good at that QB sneak.  It's unfair.  Fireball and apple cider.  Trust me, it's good.  Damnit.  I think patriots will get a touchdown and I hate that.  Damnit.  Please get a fucking touchdown Ravens.  I don't want the patriots to win.  Please flacco.  Get the td.  Please convert this 4th down Holy fuck.  I think I might have a heart attack.  This game though.  Damnit.  Fuck this.  It's over.  Patriots are gonna win.   Do people serious think that the lions are gonna win today? \"If everybody in this room want to be real with themselves\" the Lions are gonna get destroyed and Stafford will continue his ways of losing on the road to teams with a winning record. It also doesn't help that The Cowboys somehow went 4-0 in December winning by at least 10 points each game.  I really want the Cowboys to choke, but it's not happening.  Bet on the Cowboys covering the spread for easy money.  I really want the lions to win, but I don't see it happening.  Whatever, Aaron Rodgers next week will show Romo what a truly elite QB looks like.   For those wondering, the quote is from Jameis \"I can't read or speak English\" Winston Wait.  I'm pretty sure if Cowboys win, they go against the packers.  Or are you saying they will beat the packers? How many times will the media suck Romo's dick if they win this game? I was confused when you said Cowboys and seattle had a date next week Regardless of who we want to win, we can all agree that the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders are hot.  We need to have fhe camera on them, instead of the terrible commercials.  I love her.  Damnit.  So conflicted.  Do I root for the Cowboys because Suh is a piece of shit, or do I root for the Lions because I hate the Cowboys? So whose girl does DeMarco Murray steal if they win this game? Yeah baby.  A 3 and out Wow.  That was loud Woohoo.  Lions strike first.  I am going to laugh so hard if the Cowboys lose another playoff game.  Especially against the lions who haven't won a road game against a winning team, with stafford.  Best spot on a punt I have ever seen.  That's not saying much.  Yeah Stafford Come on Lions.  You can do it.  I'm regretting my bet on Cowboys covering the spread, if things don't change quick.  Should have known Cowboys would find a way to choke this game away Lions up 14-0 in the 1st quarter.  I didn't see this coming from a mile away.  Haha.  Good joke So this is the real Dallas Cowboys If the lions score a touchdown before the end of this half, it's not looking good for the typical playoff choking Cowboys.  Looks like the Cowboys didn't feel like waiting until the 4th quarter to choke.  That McDonald's commercial was so weird.  Haha.  Offensive PI OMG.  A touchdown by the same player who committed the offensive PI.  Bold move.  I seriously can't believe I thought the Cowboys would win by at least 10 points.  No More of these shitty commercials.  Holy fuck.  An interception already Leave it to romo to get sacked again HAHA.  He missed the field goal.  Holy shit.  You can't make this kind of stuff up.  So do none of these teams want to face the seahawks or packers.  It sure seems like it.  So do none of these teams want to face the seahawks or packers.  It sure seems like it.  The Cowboys just suck.  They get the ball after a pick and can't do shit.  Now the lions are tearing their defense apart.  This is why I should have never thought the Cowboys would win.   Cowboys are down 13 points, as the 7 point favorites of this game.  That is how bad the Cowboys are choking.  They are choking worse than Kim Kardashian did when she was sucking Reggie Bush's dick.  Hey, when is the last time the Patriots and Cowboys won a super bowl? Since when does Romo not Romo.   Damn.  Dez Bryant made a huge play.  Holding.  Huge momentum shift.  I think aikman just came in his pants Looks like it's the lions who might be choking now.  Wow.  That hit must have hurt.  They should just have her in the commercial naked.  Romo just loves to dance in the pocket It's like a game between which team will choke harder.  My heart can't take this rollercoaster of a game.  Can one of these teams just quit? I don't really now if that was such a good call Hug momentum shift.  Somebody is gonna have a heart attack by the end of this game Somebody is gonna have a heart attack by the end of this game Somebody is gonna have a heart attack by the end of this game Hahaha.  You deserve an upvote Go for it Fuck this game.  I either wanted the Cowboys to cover the spread, so I can win some money, or for them to outright lose.  Looks like those both won't happen. Fuck this shit NOT THIS WAY.  DAMNIT.  That was so stupid.  He should have just went down.  What an idiot. Let's fucking go Packers.  Beat the Cowboys and show us who the real elite quarterback in the league is.  I can't wait for the Cowboys to lose Am I the only one who tried to see if bandwagon.net was an actual website? Damnit.  With this calf injury, my nightmare super bowl matchup of Cowboys vs Patriots has a higher chance of being a reality.  Yeah Eddie Lacy.   Maybe, but I want he packers to win, so I don't have to think about that.  That pass is why he is the best quarterback in the league.  I'm not sure what to think about that Dez Bryant commercial.  DAMNIT.   We all know how that one turned out  Fuck this shit.  Rodgers, can you please find your cape? Can we stop bitching about the refs?  They haven't been as bad as people think.  How about the Cowturds? It kind of makes him human.  But it's Ice Bowl II YES.  Hell yeah The refs really want to make it to the Super Bowl.  I fucking hate the Cowboys.  I fucking hate the Cowboys.  Yes.  A Murray fumble.  But I love your cheerleaders.  That was dumb to do.  Hey, did you guys know that this is Ice Bowl II? You mean that a rematch can happen in the same exact venue?  Now my mind is blown.  Time for Brandon Weeden and Matt Flynn to come in.  Romo and Rodgers are hurt.  Just tuned in.  So happy that gruden and torico are the commentators.  Well.  The cardinals need to do something to stop this Panthers momentum.  If they don't it's going to get uglier Yeah Cam Newton.  Keep on smiling.  This is your moment Lindley showing why he is the 3rd string quarterback That was one long explanation These AT&amp;T commercials are growing on me Damnit Lindley.  You suck. Wow.  Game Over. Cam Newton finally has a playoff win.  I really feel bad for the cardinals though.

Think about how many hours a typical office worker spends at work every week day vs. how many hours we spend at home on a week day. There have been a few elections where I just squeaked in before the polls closed, but I could have done it on my lunch break if I could have voted near work.  I moved in with a roommate to get out of my parents' house when I really couldn't afford it. Went from living in a safe, clean environment with people who care about each other and split the responsibility of running a household to living with a passive aggressive bipolar hoarder who felt entitled to having me do more work in the house because her job sucked. The American way. It was awful. Fortunately, I can afford my own place now, and life is much better.  Chronic pain. I can't fix what is wrong yet. I still have to get up and put on a stoic face and continue with my life. It doesn't help that my chronic pain is female related, so I can't talk about it except with a few close friends.  Uh huh.  Every now and then, I might like a really unpleasant status update on the pain to relay to my surgeon, but most of the time, I'd like to be able to bend over and tie my shoes without feeling like I'm getting stabbed in the abdomen.  Mine is endometriosis. I am headed for surgery, but everything in the obgyn world moves slowly. The wait times to see doctors when you're not either literally dying or pregnant can drag everything out for months. I'm in the home stretch now, and may get surgery as early as march.  I have a few close friends with autoimmune disorders. I've been well trained to never make assumptions about a person's energy level or physical ability based on what they can *usually* do.  Uterine lining goes rogue and grows elsewhere in the abdomen, causing scaring that can bind the reproductive organs to other organs or the abdominal wall, awful pain during the cycle, a pressure sensation constantly, ovarian cysts, and a sharp tearing sensation during certain movements or in certain positions. For example, I have to sit crouched over to the left.  Only permanent treatment is menopause, which I'm too young for with my family history of osteoporosis. I'll settle for cleaning out of the rogue tissue and probably losing 1 ovary, which may work but is rarely permanent.  \n\nIt outright fucking sucks. \n\nEdit: whoops. I figured you were asking me what it was, not if I have it. Context is everything!  Yes, that's what it is.  I'm glad you got it worked out.  I don't have it anywhere near this bad.  I'm thankful mine is not my back. Soft tissue still fucking sucks, but spine injuries will ruin your whole life. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Endometriosis.  East coast.  I do have a terrific Dr. though.   A good doctor makes a huge difference.  Mine is terrific and specializes in treatment of endometriosis.  She uses robotic surgery techniques.  Hang in there, and good luck with your appointment next month.  Do plenty of research ahead of time so you know what questions to ask.  One really important point is that, while hormone therapy (usually starting with birth control pills) can hide the symptoms, it does not cure the problem and is merely temporary - you are just kicking the can down the road.  For a lot of women, particularly those of us who are either done having kids or not interested in having kids, that's not worth the side effects.  I've approached this being open about the fact that I am pro-surgical treatment, and I think my doctor has responded well to that since that is her specialty to the letter. I feel like we really get each other.

Ness has a grab.\n\nit kinda always kills. no shulk? pretty much.\n\nstep 1. back throw them at high percentage's.\n\nstep 2. if they live, pk pulse them forcing them to either get hit by it or avoid the edge and not make the grab to the edge.\n\nstep3. profit.\n\nyou wouldn't believe how many people i've killed with pk pulse. ikr. you host. so sorta like my banette in pokemon? why? so i can beat you then have you complain that 'ERRRMY GUD YOU USE NESS AND YOU GRAB YOU SUCK'?\n\nlol no. sence silver has to go, 1v1? meh. its hoe's that only work on faces instead of the ground. you added a random 'not' into your statement.  i was in the process of somehow 2-0ing you, THATS WORTH A TAUNT! @alex who's internet wad that?\n\nalso gg's. ah. fine itachi, ill 1v1 you.\n\nas soon as you return my pokemon. NOOB! @alex i feel that sonic vs ness match would of been alot closer if i didn't SD. :p yeah. &gt;me: so you would rather face a ness?\n\n&gt;you: YES!\n its ness.\n\nand bringing up the 'itachi grab thing' if i do the same thing, you could learn to avoid it. you'd prob win, it's just i would of gotten sonic to a higher percentage, i have no hope of beating your sonic. im not saying i would of won. awesome. shit like this is why i don't 1v1 you. -_- kewl.  no it isn't. 2 things.\n\n1, itachi kewl. your better then me at smash, so is every1 here but ty.\n\n2, HOW IS IT EASYIER FOR ME TO BEAT ALEX AT SMASH THEN ITACHI? SHUT UP! AND GOT YOU TO 1 STOCK 70% EVERY OTHER TIME! and then got 2 stocked.\n\ncan i make a bs excuse now? so, im goona quit the 1v1 right now.\n\n50 bucks says itachi will brag about virtually nothing. bs. sup. that moment when you realize im one of the worst people here and beating me means nothing.\n\nunless you're ty. um............ no. so im just wondering why alex keeps pestering me about 1v1's, then tell me to not use my main character. :/ can i has one now? which coment reply was that? either shit like that is why i don't 1v1 you. and pokemon rapist. here's my number.............. im not goona 1v1 some1 who is better then me, then tells me i suck.  im AC-DC6 ive never 1v1'd you till today. because i never have. and stuff like that is WHY i never have. im explaining that the one day i decide to 1v1 some1 alex acts like a dick. i dont care, but it alwqys nice to have people not be a dick. \n\nare trying to piss me off or something? i did, and i dont care, but it's always nice  to have 1 less person be a dick to you. whoooo! es te hard knock life! kewl. 1, yes\n\n2, idfk obviously its hasty.

BREEDABLE ONLY IS SHIT! ian, make me an aproved submitter.\n\ni seriously need to see these new rules without people quoting them. the rule means i can't use ~~any of my competitive~~ every single pokemon i own. ;( no it means i cant use A SINGLE POKEMON I OWN! ikr. he truley is kicking us out. no, thats not what it means. if thats truley the rule then whoever worded it like that is fucking retarded. no, i don't own any other mons. only now? duh, dat pu/nu pokemon is too op 42? and that is a FUCKING STUPID REASON TO NOT HAVE LEGENDS!\n\nwhat? because your legends are 6iv and competitive they can't be used, THATS THE MOST RETARDED THING I'VE HEARD! IT MIDAS WELL BE BRED ONLY BY THAT STUPID LOGIC! oh yeah, dem hitchhikers tho. pretty sure its pu but not positive. stupid ass rule...... &gt;Nope, don't have enough powers.\n\nthis is what kev gives the 'head mod' everybody! so little trust in his main mod he can't even mod others.\n\nim starting to think toshiro is smarter then this guy. YOU HAVE TOO SAY IT UNTIL YOU CHANGE THE RULE DUMBASS! only breeded pokemon there, and ditto isn't breedable. maybe.\n\nOR go with the majority of the competitive battling and use smogon rules. sorta.\n\nkev said that cause alpha modded pat, and kev cant edit powers/demod mods that he didn't make a mod.\n\nhe made frost a mod. no, he doesn't trust you. bad choice. kev, the inactive alpha. the inactive james. ian, nee I CANT SEE CAUSE IM NOT A SUBMITTER! because kev doesn't trust you. you shouldn't, i never asked you to. the place is stupid. because your losing the argument? lol, ian runs away cause he's losing the argument. lol. thats why you use m-bro. that was a long time to make an excuse.\n\n*lie comfirmed* srry but ditto is banned. xatu &gt; espeon its banned bann him from the subbreddit im goona get a ditto, choice band it, and name it 'Stupid rule'. sex whore? &gt;  #______....\n\nwho DAFUQ says that? http://imgur.com/pqODuWi i saw that same post lolz.

(or in this case, lack of stuff) &gt;you're a fucking piece of shit\n\neven if it isnt intentional, any comment can cause offence, regardless of its intneded purpose.\n\nand no, this is an example, im not calling you this. just a question.\n\nwhy don't the the DE and ol team up?\n\nlets be honest, alex is right, (with the exception of jamie) the only reason kev gets hate is because he is inactive AF. if we could somehow come to an agreement where both k99 and kev ***have equal say and can debate things out***, then maybe we could actually get along.\n\nthis is just a thought, concidering neither of you two will get anywhere at the rate you are going. and if you guys combine with both an active and inactive leader, maybe we could actually get along for once sence miiverse.\n\nian/somebodywithaccess, tell the DE this. maybe something can be arranged. why? because kev said some mean words to you?\n\n thanks. 1, pick a type. im not water so you're good there.\n\n2, k99 and kev would be the ONLY1's with full powers, meaning a full agreement would have to come to agreement, so kev can f things up based on his sole judgement. so no petty 'flair arguments'\n\n3, ian is in the process of copying our banner, i doubt that if we would combine that any DE member would change it.\n\n4, i'd rather things would get a bit harder on us if it actually ment we all became **actual friends again.** 1,you don't even need mod premissions. \n\n2.&gt; Kev will accuse us of bullying and ban us.\n\nWHAT PART OF K99 AND KEV WILL HAVE TO AGREE ON SOMETHING DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?\n\n3, kev doesn't manipulate people, he's one of the worst speach makers ever. :p\n\n4, kev was just too damn lazy to learn to use CSS, so he asked toshiro for help.\n\n5 &gt;after we've created a better league turn around and team up with him\n\nhow many people know of the DE?\n\nhow many know of the OL?\n\nyeah no the DE is better as a league. just cause you guys are better looking doesn't make you a better league.\n 1, we can hope an agreement is made.\n\niknew that making this, but i didn't want 2 people aways outvoting 1 in a 3 leadership base.\n\n2, so we aren't separated like we currently are. nobody, *yet*\n\ntake into account it is a entirely new league, i say you and silver could restart your challenge ground up with it being a new thing.\n\ni'd like to think of it as a 'fresh start' to all of this, and just forget anything bad that happened before, or actually just improve on our mistakes from the past and ***learn*** from them and rebuild a better league ground up. defog SR skarm. *1 legend rule intensify's* &gt;brother leagues\n\nHA! you know full well k99 never intended that. \n\nthe idea may work, but i think getting every1 together for once will be better for every1. hey, you're a good battler, you can do it. :D hardly, if it goes through he'll prob go for steel, maybe. IM A TURTLE NOT A FISH!\n\njoke/puns aside, how? 1, he did say that, tho i say his actions make that statement BS\n\n2, jamie is just anti-kev, ive said enough there wont be bs banns made by 1 person.\n\n3, exactly, you are copying size, witch means for the most part your sub doesn't look better, meaning we wont have sub problems if we just let the makes of this sub arrange the new/old sub(s) 1.wrong, i **hate** kev, im not on his side, im just trying to get every1 to be friends again.\n\n2, i havnt gotten any pm's.\n\n3.YOU KNOW FULL WELL MAKING THIS YOU DIDNT INTEND THIS AND THE DE TO BE BROTHER LEAGUES!\n\nit could work, but seperation will only make it worse. all the more reason to combine. we aren't friends with people that stay in the de. :/\n\n thats why you **AND** kev can be leaders. OH LOOK! ITS KEV2.0! ALWAYS GOTTA HAVE THE IRL THING TO PULL YOU AWAY **EH!?** &gt;Honestly, I don't feel like being all that kind and caring\n\ni cant work with this people...... excuse me for trying to help.................. whats this? we can make a new subbreddit and let kev do work? sounds ke--wait wait.\n\nwhats that?\n\nyou're already giving frost the CSS anyway?\n\nWELL THEN THERE'S NO PROBLEM. im actually speechless. ask him what he's doing keeping the de alive. the banners CSS. k99 still gave him CSS. ITS ALMOST LIKE IVE SAID THAT BEFORE! exactly, you don't want to be brother leagues. :/ i half agree with him.\n\nits perfectly fine when we are actually having challengers. but when its just a chat, WHY?!?!?!?!?! ok, fuck you too. so you wanna be color blind? thats how you get console banned. bruh, do you have a good m-bro team? pls make 1? bruh, ill let you use it, then ill pull a haxgod, but i wont brag about it and ill give you credit. you can get costumes from adventure mode? *insert that vine*\n\nhey the race fits. :o [Funfact: a kart racer won the last MKWII WiFi race.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC6Qrvs2vvo) ive always used karts lolz. &gt;Third, I disagree in that a leader must be active all the time. My view is that we should be a team, where everyone contributes with their grain of sand and the leader coordinates those efforts to make it work. If this system works properly, no one will have to put to\u00f3 much time or effort. I do know however that I should be more active, and I apologize for that and promise I will eventually have more time. At first I was around all the time, back on Miiverse. I learned it wasn't good for me to spend so much time on something that wasn't productive. I remember having arguments with my then GF because she got mad that I didn't pay her attention when I was witj her, instead overusing my phone.\n\nI agree keV, that's how it should be, but there's problems with how you run it.\n\n1.you don't, give every1 full permissions. Whenever something happens only the most inactive people can do shit about it, meaning that not every1 (just talking about mods) gets an equal say so.\n\n2.NOT EVERY1 GETS A FAIR SAY! Only once Sence moving here have we takin a vote. Other then that every other time instead of acting like a group, you just come in and give your one opinion, enforce it, then leave. If we worked as a team your inactiveness would be fine, but in a world where all the mods can do is wait on your opinion, teamwork doesn't exist. When I said full permissions, I ment like equal say, so you can combine my 2 points I guess.\n\nAlso you don't unintentionally inforce your opinion, because with no1 being above you, no1 can argue with you.\n\nAnd I won't deny that there are more mature people then others, but back when we were getting along, this did still apply.\n\nRegardless of how I've acted, I DO want to help you out. At this point my main focus is getting every1 back together like the old days.  James doesn't do much. 1,sup\n\n2,its battle maison, it'll change its move depending on yours. so the 1 turn i dont switch on its snore it protects?\n\nyeah no. yeah you ~~showed your true colors~~ broke your cool. &gt;i don't hate the place, i was making constructive criticism (which has been taken into account and implimented) then silver started acting like a twat, then rulesharked. oh well, kids will be kids [time to train lana](http://www.siliconera.com/postgallery/?p_gal=457875|10) No pk flash is. Yet he still hasn't learned to dodge a grab. All of you are wrong, a pk flash kill is most satisfying. YOU THOUGHT WRONG!  I Type corrected, tho how many times have you killed with that taunt?\n\nIve killed with pk flash commonly. And thus, alex's temper broke. Don't face me 1v1 then. me getting rekt doesn't change the fact that you can't dodge grabs. he's not............\n\nmy ness is tho. then beat junito in a 1v1 idiot. then complained about grabs. why u wanna be mono psychic? why not mono dark? sure. wait i gtg. :( stop giving advice and let people have there own playstyle.

ABUSING OF MOD POWERS!\n\nalso i could be psychic, duh. im fine with it, i just wonder why both yours and silvers mono fighting had hawlucha on it. 0_o\n\nalso i'd be a hypocrite if i told you to, i use ludicolo and rotom-w on my water team. :p this the point where i wanna say aden ***SHOULD*** be smart enough to know im not water, but i can't. &gt;:( im actually fine with my new text flair, lolz. because m-mawile, rotom-w, talonflame, and mega metagross. *it still sickens me* so im actually goona go for whatever type aden goes for to spite him. ***it still sickens me***\n\nalso *4 bug mega's so silver, if i admitt you win the argument, do i gets my flair (and original text) back?\n\n thats still a thing? lolz.\n\nalso why isn't kyurem-W usable on ice mono's? scizor is OU bruh. fine. not in ice monotypes. *uses protect* so are you saying m-scizor is uu? no, aden's stupidity makes him think this is the de. don't mention it, good thing you predicted that obscure move no singles metagross has.\n\n*i hope* its not ubers in banlists?\n\nthat means its not banned at all........... any mega is actually the same (or higher) then its reg counterpart, *misses anyway*\n\ncmon, you know i sumhow get dat 1 lucky hax in our battles. inb4 mine is dual type and his is singular. inb4 i could be psychic. guys we need to take away silver's flair, i keep thinkings he's fighting elite. inb4 they do. have you ever played the monotype ladder? impossible, a mega cant be lower cause then i could use its higher counterpart in a lower teir.\n\ntake for instance m-garchomp. it SHOULD be uu, but i cant use garchomp in uu, so m-chomp is ou. inb4 we all know jamies water. SD and HC?\n\nbad set bruh. guy we need to kick out silver, i keep thinking he's a mineral. so jamie can ONLY be water while i could be either or, ***and any1 with a brain*** could use process of elimination to figure out who's who. can i get my slow bruh flair back.\n\nill try to get in a BV of my team soon, *but im only at the 2nd gym* correct.  srry, but real life and hyrule warriors and finals weak take up time. :( but you have to think it could also be secondary. &gt;No, because M-Pin is primary Bug.

But not all. *scarfed chandelure intensify's.* You stop being a hipocrite and never use powersaves. So? Gts. You stop being a hypocrite. Naw, description s always true, thats how I got my ffa snorlax. Sure, as soon as you explain how I am currently being a hypocrite. Simple, when here youve always complained about powersaves, and now youre getting one, but unlike your next comment, I have people who can testify to you saying that, while ive never had a problem with powersavers, smash any1? aden be all like: Aden the hypocrite got a new flair. i feel like i should get a power save, but im broke. tru. lisa?\n\nthe toshiro lisa? delete it. then my boy olimar.\n\n*some day.......* yeah, the fountain = coop. duh. dont remind me. :( Ness is 11. :D then go on for glory. what works, works man. we can dream. sonic 3006. ~~not denying it~~ sure. wrong person. ~~it takes even more skill to dodge it if you see it coming~~. to make the oponent think he didn't have it. what do you have? You're a hypocrite hes moderator of..... you need to stop trolling. look where its gotten you. for zelda it atleast fit.\n\ncould you imagine it for mario? he needs to stop trolling. What's a copier?\n\n*looks at this and nnid* if petey phirana is a playable character, ill get it. ER MY GUD!\n\nplayable dimentio. lets do this. we need to actually make a list.\n\nalso i think like maybe it would be cia = bowser, and ganon = dimentio storyline wise. villians for 'mushroom warriors':\n\nbowser (duh)\n\nking boo (duh)\n\ndimentio\n\nshadow queen\n\nwario?\n\nsmithy i ment maybe story line wise.\n\ni cant see shroob or antasma ~~(who even?)~~ i haven't played dream team.\n\ncackletta maybe, and im ashamed i forgot fawful. i looked it up.\n\nalso idc, as long as i get playable dimentio im set for life. but dimention is a better puppet master.\n\nof course bowser would be the final boss, but if dimention in it then bowser will prob play the pawn at one point...... coward bird still kills you. its to protect against special talonflames. i wish talon got air slash, so i could use special talon. ech. true.\n\ntho this is the part where i say that i havent played dream team.\n\nalso your argument is invalid, dimentio HAD bowser as his puppet in SPM, bowser may be smart, but dimentio is far to clever/crazy for that. pikachu, Duh.\n\ngardevior, for the girls. duh-ishj\n\nsuicane= HOW THE FUCK? so i saw pokken trailer, it looks AMAZING!\n\nit loks like a cross between any warriors game (over the top attacks), soulcalibur/tekken (3d fighting games), and pokemon.\n\n*insta buy* im sure several people are.\n\nalso i ment it as a \"ninetndo will have both a male/female looking roster\"\n\nALSO with suicane i can see metagross as a reality. *flash back to mk DD*\n\nHIGH IM DAISY whats a budget? hopes for pokken:\n\nslowbro\n\nludicolo\n\nregigigas\n\nan eevee that can change forms at will\n\nmew/two\n\narceus\n\ndarmanitan (with zen mode)\n\ngenesect\n\n garchomp\nscizor\n\nlando-T well sorta, he did fool every1 tho. \"idgaf bout a uu pokemon i dont use\" tbf pokken wasnt announced at that time and he said the main problems were that there were hardly any good games for it. no its nick furry telling herry he's a super sayin on tatooine &gt;\"idgaf bout a uu pokemon i dont use\" he still fooled every1 tho. not my fault mario is faster then sonic lolz. and i agree. &gt;&gt;\"idgaf bout a uu pokemon i dont use\" are you competitive?\n\ni ask this as you dont know how its ou and you thought talon was uber. no, i act like people know the metagame they play. so, i still know the metagame. YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYES!\n\ni love this design choice. *uses legendary taunt toxic mon* Im at anime club ATM Lolz. So hypocritical. Thats why you use my flair. Lol I just remembered something.\n\nAden used a swampert on his fire team, Lolz. no, you just suck too much ass. no he was trying to counter team me.\n\nluckily i had a scarfer to beat his mega. ru suspect meaning going to ru or will be banned from ru? eviolite. i see surp and pidgey being banned from RU, but not dragalage. smash ffa any1? wii u pad. use it. i wasnt goona 1v1. yup, kill it every time.\n\n wii u pad is best. thats what happens to edge guarders lol. tru. i use the wii u pad for everything. kirby 1v1 tho. not realy. i never use it. srry, had to do something. i have one, i just dont use.\n\nkinda like all my mon type teams. how so? then up b doesn't work.\n\nARRRRRG! i'd like to thank the spam academy. who quit? no it isn't. i was goona 1v1 you lolz. so im still up for team battle now that im back. m-bro\n\nserperior\n\nkyurem-b\n\nlando-t\n\nscizor\n\nchandelure/weavile. i need p-save services. go on for glory and use him.\n\nin a week, you'll learn him. idfk, i learned my bowser jr and ness in a week. :/ xaldin is fucking impossible.\n\nhe will go down as the only boss ive ever lost to using cheats. (not the infinite hp cheat tho.) you need to learn to play with them. but going into master form and getting anti is almost impossible........... when's the next opening in your room? maybe its cause the action replay i used gave me infinite bars but IDK.\n\n i wanted to bowser jr him but meh.  fuck you too. change it to ~~time~~ 3 stocks pls. is bowser jr the only1 that can triple hop in ssb4? because we thought you rq from time. :/ lol, where did you come from alpha?\n\nstop stalking us de. yes because you are always in a tourny. &gt;Wow. You guys don't even give me time to get back. Thanks.\n\n*junito hasnt even tried to join yet*\n\n*claps* We could, or we could continue fighting, the purpose of the game. but you still left. ive waited longer.\n\npatience is a virtue. no we can't. we bought the game so we could play it. problem? this. yes, i have waited longer. but unlike you i learned to live with it and not throw a hissy fit cause i couldn't play for 2 minutes. and a new flair. no you gotta wait. soareyourdoctorwhogifs.jpg then you should learn how to deal with this in life. nothereworse.jpg sonic is for beginers. yup. too bad the same apply's for us. do it, please.\n\nalso k99 still wont let me join. who? ill take blame and get only us banned. \n\ntaking 1 for the team m8. really? cause last i checked my emotions playing a role in who i am doesnt mean i cant adapt. ask k99 BAN HIM. &gt;my game will get corrupted one more time. DO YOUR SIDE SMASH. not caring what **others think of me** isnt the same as having no emotions lol. you pray your game isn't corrupted. NO AGAINST INACTIVE PEOPLE. in the situation of what people think of me, no i don't. wow, aden's game is so corupted now.\n\ndoes any1 have a *jolly* (yes ik wtf im doing) articuno for trade? SO ANYWAYS you need patience boy. koopa car &gt; wario car.\n\n im not one of your people boi. hypocrite. *checks elite list*\n\nno im not. gg's. im not. if i was i'd be fairy by now. sticky web mamo?\n\n*facepalm* . &gt;:[ bruh, alex and junito will say your conflicted on the inside, where silvers comments make you debate whether you care or not ALL BECAUSE you said 'idgaf bout what you say'\n\nthat, OR my bowser jr is so annoying and they want revenge, cause there just dicks to me for some reason but IDK.  ]:&lt; bruh, alex and junito will say your conflicted on the inside, where k99 comments make you debate whether you care or not ALL BECAUSE you said 'idgaf bout what you say' YOU WOULDN'T LET ME JOIN AND NOW ALL THE GOOD TYPES ARE TAKIN!

No, you'd prob still wouldn't let me in if I got there. Says the guy who thinks talon is uber. I still get my point across. Jamie thinks the exact same thing. That was be4 I even started becoming competitive. I already know he won't. It's hard to take you seriously when you talk about the OU tier when you obviously know nothing about it. I'm not. Because it's not like I've done anything else on other places idiot. HA I didn't do it cause I had no motivation. Noob And you wonder why I don't even try to join. Welcomebai Fuck you. Not u, fighting is one of my least favorite types.

How much smaller do you want it? I found out how to adjust the size.  I'm gonna just try to make it to where it'll mostly fit on the sidebar.  There, I uploaded the new, and improved Breloom pic. See how it looks. (I'd put it in there myself, but I don't know where the sidebar shit is when you've got all the other shit in there) Nevermind I put it in there myself. IDK why there's an assload of space between it, and the words though.  I'll put that other Breloom pic up for you to look at.  WOOOOOOOOOOOO I DID IT!!! I changed it to Breloom before I changed anything else on purpose. :) NOOOO!!! GET OUT!!! I WANNA KEEP WORKING WITH THE STYLESHEET!!! I changed the pic again.  Shut yo dumbass up.

That looked ridiculously easy ... damn these angry birds RIP Amendola's playoff touches This game is gonna be over quickly if New England's defense doesn't wake up. \"If we don't come back you are fucking fired, lady\" Of course, so no matter what the outcome, the game is fixed.  That's impressive. Ravens going with the bold \"Don't cover their best player\" strategy. They shouldn't be playing football at all.  Not while four of the seven horcruxes are still unfound. Wow.  I'm not sure every team completed passes to ten different receivers all year. Alright everyone.  Let's try to break the 50,000 comment threshold. Still not as bad as when RG3 took a timeout to avoid a delay at his own 1. Torrey just adding to Flacco's stats with his penalty. Wow.  Doesn't there have to be an announcement by the referee, just like when a player declares himself eligible? Except they don't even have a live show tonight for some reason. I don't think that \"defense getting tired\" cliche works when they've looked like this all game. Someone call Seattle and tell them to delay the game by a half hour.  I still see a few more touchdowns coming out of this one. When he stumbled, on third and three, in the fourth quarter of a playoff game... I was almost expecting him to find Terrell Owens in the endzone. I run around as long as possible then take a safety. Holy shit was that close. Two fumbles and one non-fumble on the play that should have been a fumble.  This game is gonna be interesting. Tate's still not sure where he is. Greatest punt in NFL history? Was that Jeff Triplette on the Lions sideline? Did they just decide not to enforce that unsportsmanlike after the TD? Pete Morelli should not be an NFL referee Nothing could make me want Beats less than showing Troy Aikman and Joe Buck acting like 13 year old girls while wearing them. We must kill the fatted calf for the gods. Let's stop trying to make this the ice bowl.  It's like 20 degrees out. Why does every football fan need to haul thousands of pounds, I wonder. I think it's more alcohol than dedication Terrance \"I don't exist in the regular season\" Williams. Defense needs to win it for Green Bay.  They can't afford to get down by multiple possessions with Rodgers unable to throw accurately. Is Jeff Triplette being punished by the NFL by being forced to stand in the cold? Stealing yards like perfume from a department store. I think the only winner in this game might be Seattle. \"Wide receiver is a hard position to make an impact as a rookie.\"  Is that cliche really valid this year?  Watkins, Beckham, Evans, Benjamin... My heart says Arizona but my head says Carolina.  Either way, I can't wait for playoff football Did he think he was a hockey goalie? Their run formations are way too obvious.  Spread it out and at least pretend you're going to pass it. God I love that call What the hell is Arians wearing? Terrible pass, but huge tackle by Newton.

In Michigan you can get a handle with your chips and dip. It's like they know I'm a Lions fan.\n\nIn Wisconsin I'm pretty sure I've seen Spotted Cow on sale at day care. I wouldn't know. Took him like 2 minutes to bring up Stafford's 0-17 stat. Fuck that, only stat that matters now is 7-0. Pretty sure every team gets called for that. Sometimes the truth is funny, too. CO also has a law where they only allow one liquor store per franchise. So no chains. This means that I have to ride past a Trader Joe's (In Denver) to go to one that's four miles further round trip if I also want to get wine or Liquor, since they are only allowed one liquor store in the state.\n\nAnd yet there are chain dispensaries. Come drink at altitude in Denver. \n\nYou'll still win, but *only barely.* But they both have two syllables in their first and last names! How can we not win it all?

We've also been much better about making second half adjustments this year, and have been able to keep the pressure on, especially on D.\n\nI'm scaroused. As a born Michigander who was there for 0-16, explain to me how and why you would choose the Lions voluntarily? That just doesn't compute. Gonna need a Megatron stanky leg gif. I dig it!

Yep, pretty fucking Lions. Yes, we are wondering if they're gonna pick that one up, too. Thank you. Still ahead as of right now, against a team that's really hot and could make it to the super bowl if they can make it through us first. I still believe in this team.

A game is 60 minutes long not 6 Those kind of penalties are the pussiest ass penalties in the league. What the fuck God is rooting for the Lions.  This is the flukiest drive I've ever soon.

Motherfuckers acting like this game was over in the first quarter.  Really mad we didn't run What a tragic turn of events. I don't even know what to say Livid might be the correct word right now. Well we won the division I guess. This is our last chance at a momentum swing let's go Cowboys! Shame you didn't get to participate  *checks flair*\n\nYep Bullshit The Lions fans are great. Even the Seahawks and Packers in here are representing their fanbases well. But the Eagles in here? Holy shit it's pathetic. We got a game here! I haven't seen any of the Taken series. Now I'm afraid to watch the first one knowing that the serious became a joke. SWOLE BEASTLY DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT A TARGETING People in here actually salty about an obvious targeting? The Cowboys hate digs deep... Ridiculous how quickly Reddit can change their minds about a player. Whatever the new circlejerk is I guess. HUGE hold on Crawford Flair bet anyone? No way the Cowboys are losing this game.\n\nEdit: packers guy got here first Good. Cowboys flair until the next time the Packers win and other way around. Witten baby! We are getting helped so hard on this drive. Sorry for the salt earlier because it's definitely equaled out. Looks like I have to vote for Chris Christie now next time he runs for something here in Jersey. Why do people leave Witten open? Never leave Witten open. Homerism aside, you can make the case for one of the Alltime greatest. He's right behind Gonzales in most statistical categories. Generous spot. Thank you based refs. Can't complain. That's fair. Bailey has been off since he took that hit against the Bears. He's not 100% at all. \"Let's\"? The Eagles aren't playing. Homecooking! /s Lawrence making big plays in big games! Come on defense that's horseshit That's actually not a penalty. Damn it looked like he broke it too! Murray would still be running if it wasn't for Peppers. Lang is a cunt. Gimme those yards You're goddamn right! As if we needed more controversial bullshit against teams that think they're owed a win. Eat that fucking stiff arm Clay Which injured QB will prevail!?

Poor McNabb, people are going to come and throw footballs just short of his grave stone one day.   Dat trick play tho That pass was modern art.   ...and the Pats lead for the first time all night.   If there was ever a time for a deep ball to draw PI, this would be it.   Pretty clearly a fumble, I'd consider challenging if I were Belichick just for the bonus in field position from where it was recovered, especially since they are going for it. Timeout-taking intensifies... See, that's the problem with throwing it up and hoping for a flag.  Sometimes the other guy just catches it.   I believe in Matthew Stafford. RES tagged.   This has the potential to replace Manningface M That's a good start for Detroit's D.  I don't think the Lions can win this one if they get behind at any point, so they need to score first to have a shot IMO.   Damn, Staff threw a missile on that pass.   Wow, ballsy to run up the middle in that situation.   Gutsy run by Stafford, can't believe he pulled that off. This is going way better for the Lions than I expected.   Dallas's offensive line seems to have evaporated.  Romo is going to get killed out there at this rate.   Dallas's offensive line seems to have evaporated.  Romo is going to get killed out there at this rate.   Both punters have been on point today.   Dallas is going to put up over 20 points in this game eventually, Detroit needs to be careful about getting comfortable.   Detroit's defensive front are the mvps of this game right now.   That American Sniper movie looks pretty heavy.   Well yeah, that's why they are releasing it now as well.  They got it in just before the end of the year.   Dallas is kinda getting hosed by the refs this game, and this is coming from a Redskins fan.   Shouldn't have said anything.   I'd hold him every play until they started calling it if it were me.   I believe it's something like 20k by the first half of the last Super Bowl IIRC. IMO spot is moved up, still just shy of the 1st. That was superb defense over the middle. Sarude - Dandstorm They won't notice the difference, it's Detroit.   I don't live in DC. Wow.  That's a a lot of nothing to get from such good field position.   Milana Vayntrub, she's a cutie They're going to call that every time.    \n  \nEDIT:  Wow, never seen that before.   You should probably tackle a guy.   No joke, the reffing in this game has been extremely questionable and both teams have been hurt by it at different times.   He pretty clearly touched him, that's not really disputable.  You can argue that the contact was legal, but the contact objectively happened.   Jerry Jones paid some fucking refs.   There was a PI call on Dallas that would have kept Detroit's drive going.  They threw the flag, called the PI, and then as the players were moving up the field, they picked up the flag without saying anything and left Detroit with a 4th down where they were.  It's pretty much the latest flag pick up ever and there was no explanation given for it.   Yeah, complete 180 in the second half.  Detroit is getting completely hosed now. Shouldn't Chris Christie be a Giants or Jets fan?   Really disappointed that Bandwagon.net doesn't actually exist.   Well...that's over with.   You mean pneumonia?  Phenomena sounds like a reference to that movie with Travolta where he had powers or something.   It's okay, I thought it was hilarious. Give Terence an Oscar for that one.

Ebron was a bad pick. Imagine Aaron Donald standing shoulder to shoulder with Suh. Back to back Suh sacks!! Awful decision to bring it out. This is a fucking joke. Understatement of the year. Wow, the refs just keep on fucking Detroit Hold on to your sphincters!!! Can someone knowledgeable about the rules fill me in? I thought you couldn't challenge penalties. Single coverage on Dez is almost always a bad idea. Rodgers is nowhere near 100% and he's still amazing. Why not go for 2 there? &gt;cheese \n\nThey tend to do that with everything up there. Rodgers can barely fucking walk and he's still money. McCarthy is the worst challenger since the space shuttle.\n\nEDIT: I take it back. Did not see that one coming. Why is the Panthers coach so dickless? Go for it, or at least try a FG. So... have the Cards completely given up on Logan Thomas now? #77 seems to have gotten away with an illegal block to the back. It wouldn't have affected the play though. Good no call I guess. Cardinal goal line D is airtight. It has to be though. A TD here would make a comeback very difficult. Especially with Lindley. Yes. Interestingly he's an Arizona attorney. May need to go into hiding for a while. Lindley is terrible. What's it going to take to put Logan Thomas in? Lindley is the worst QB I've ever seen in a playoff game, including Tebow. I like Kevin Hart and I'm not even black. I love Hochuli's explanations. TOP FUCKING KEK Those Rams games were the very definition of Phyrric victories for Arizona, weren't they? Those Rams games were the very definition of Phyrric victories for Arizona, weren't they? Warner is watching this shit and kicking himself for not stepping up. Lindley's getting fucking brutalized. Nice clock management.

Brady shoving guys, and his S/T taunting after a tackle After your QB shoves a dude and instigates a fight.

Guess it's even now I heard Sylar and Peter were transforming into everyone under the sun and made it super confusing lol.  But I guess not? I don't remember who Matt is but sounds interesting.  lol.   Didn't even need to collect the flag because he still caught it lol Love you Danny!!!! MVP for the Patriots so far!!!! Hey he never sniffed the playoffs with us.  He has to make up for it with you! They won't. God why did we let Amendola go to the Patriots...he is a special talent even if he is made of paper They didn't call an obvious PI on the Patriots in the first quarter though.  So they were even after the Gronk no-call.   Shhh Pats fans are super salty right now Pats can't stop the run That'll be a defensive battle with bad offense. This is an offensive battle with bad defense *Eyy They've gotten away with a few no-calls so far Amendola is Pat's MVP Time for the real playoff game! Go Lions!!! Suh is a free agent after this season right?  I wouldn't mind bringing him to the Rams :-) I love how Suh is getting held every play but still getting the sack That's sketchy as fuck.  Picking up a flag after the announcement was made?  America's team getting benefits from the refs?  Other than the ignored blatant holding? That was not a catch. Who is Green Bay's QB and what has he done with Aaron Rodgers? lol that was a bad challenge There's the Demarco \"Fumblerooski\" Murray we know See who gets ejected...

And I don't reach for questionable calls against the Cowboys and point to them as excuses.  The play in question was not an \"obvious pick\".  He got chucked at the line of scrimmage by a d-back into another d-back.  How could you not see that? Damn. Don't shank it, now. *shank it* Song please? Kay, take your 3 points.

Yup, gotta get those excuses ready. Beasley *is* the beauty. Remember that time Clay Matthews had a dirty hit on Romo? Off to a good start. The Alvin Harper to Bryant's Irvin.  Very underrated. Dude, our home games are pretty much away games. Andrew Luck needs that beard.

No no, you're emphasizing the wrong word.  Pump, *you* up. That hard count shit hasn't worked on this D all year, do you not watch film?\n\nEdit:  Guys, can someone remind me how it worked on the last drive?  My point is it's rare, and I doubt it'll happen again. They always do.  I love this defense. You're doing great.  Keep up the good work. I want to buy a restaurant just so I could give Witten free wings for life. He's put up some of the best numbers of any tight end of all time.  Plus he's always been a really good blocker. Just perfect routes every time by Witten. Oh that wasn't a first.  That'll probably get challenged. It's actually kind of a shame the Packers had to waste a challenge on such an obviously bad call. LETS JUST GIVE THE PACKERS DEFENSE SOME MORE REST PLEASE Shit. I must be missing something.  Didn't the Packers challenge the spot?  Or does that fall into the inside-two-minutes rule? Watch him drill it from 50 now.\n\nEdit:  or not. Ah, my bad then. Looks like a catch to me. Glad they got it right, I can't imagine the shitstorm that would have happened if that got over turned.\n\nAlso, SACKED God dammit. It was iffy, but I'd give it to him.  And I'd expect it to be the same if it was us. Joe Buck, please drill this \"Aaron Rodgers is limping around, what a hero\" narrative a little harder. Up 3?  Nope. It's the bare middle of the mustache that kills it.   We've gotten calls in our favor too.  Let's just have a great second half. I don't think it's real easy to make a choice here honestly. I've always said, Jeff Garcia in his prime could have that team where it is. $ Squib it, why not. WOOO BARRY Everybody hunting for that fumble. Easy call there. They got it right, thank god. Of all times. Let's go D. Hold them to 3 here. i like this Was it something they said? Love when Randle comes in and turns dynamo. Romo is built out of hardened steel and the conquests of his enemies.  He's fine. Romo's back was completely fucked to begin with.  Just another thing to play through.  Murray TD.  Cowboy football. BALL I don't even wanna know what went on at the bottom of *that* pile, lol Amazing coverage. lol Everyone talks about what an amazing athlete Percy Harvin is, and meanwhile Randall Cobb is lightyears ahead of him, and not a headcase. Fuck your hard count. Good game.  Good luck the rest of the way. I hear very loud dubstep in my head watching this. Best fans in baseball! Cheers Oh shit, Luke. The fuck was that? lol at Bersen giving the \"get away\" hands. Really good coverage. oh man. It's like they're competing to see who can lose the hardest. So did Carolina. I would love to hear Gary Busey explain the first half of this game, in his own words. Damn 95, don't help him. Cam's forgotten how to throw footballs like Rick Ankiel forgot how to throw baseballs. this fucking guy oh dear. uh oh.  that looked like good coverage.

It's alright packers, we trailed at home too and that ended up well even though I developed a heart condition. Just have your offense show grit and have your defense create a couple turnovers.

You know how you'll have those battles where you don't get haxed at all, and then you have those battles were you get haxed a fuck ton? Fuck this battle this is hyper bullshit.  Maybe my Kyurem can get some freeze hax, and save me.  BRELOOMINATI SAVE ME!!! D: DAMN TREVENANTS!!!!!!! It died to a Mega Scizor. If only this god damn Trevenant would die so my Breloom could win.  Breloom was 1-4. He's having a tough time.  I don't think I can win this battle. :'{ At least Breloom is doing his best.  But now he's 1-3 and unable to kill this god damn mother fucking stupid ass bullshit Trevenant.  This is the stupidest fucking battle I've ever had. I got haxed so much.  It's Zero I'm battling BTW. I only have 2 more Rock Tombs. ;'{ ;'{ We're down to PP stalling. ;'{ Well you see I can't kill this stupid fucking Trevenant because he has infinite Sitrus berries.  Well he sent out his Latias at least. Now I'm fighting it. ;'{ If you try to use a Ditto we'll kill you.  Can't kill the Trevenant! RUN!!! I forfeit. 100 turn battle.  Yes. I was.  Fuck Trevenant. SU8G-WWWW-WWWV-2UQA\n\n100 turns because us Brelooms never fucking give up. Ever. Unless they have a Trevenant.  ONE HUNDRED FUCKING TURNS!!! Trevenant should be banned because it can cause an infinite battle, and Smogon don't take that shit.  Because what if it's Trevenant vs Trevenant, and they can never kill each other because they both have infinite Sitrus Berries, and Struggle does less damage than the Sitrus Berries heal. \n\nOr maybe not, but fuck Trevenant. Battle me. I need to kill pokemon.  Reddit: *Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!* I DON'T FUCKING CARE IT CCCOOOOOOOUUUUUUUULLLLLLLDDDD BE INFINITE!!!! You better not get one any time soon.  Zero is the god of hax.  THANKS FOR USING KNOCK OFF ON MY TERRAKION VINNY.  Hahaha. I just love making Vinny's pokemon struggle to death.  Do you guys think I'm a phaggot for making Vinny's pokemon struggle to death when I could have just killed them? Fuck ghost type.  shofu, and pokeaim? That was my next guess. You monster... I HATE YYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!! RED!!!! Huh? Please explain yourself because I'm very stupid.  I didn't know we ever even matched.  Remind me. What is your set? Oh ok. So what's the objective of the set? But you suck. &gt;:} :O orly? Are you SUUUURE? What pokemon did I use? Ok now here's the problem I see. \n\nIf they don't want to be burned they'll probably switch out without allowing you to Mean Look them.  Yeah, but if they need the pokemon, and don't want it burned they'll switch. And if the don't care if it's burned they probably don't really need it.  dat two turn +6 I DISARO_O_ *computer dies http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/bronzong Hey Alex remember that time I said something and you said it was easily the somethingest thing I'd ever said?

But I think I might use Mega Lucario instead.  (Vinny is a dumbass like Aden used to be) TERRAKION.  bully }'; What the fuck kind of pokemon do you need anyway? halp I need special mega lucario set! Dx How about this for Mega Lucario?\n\nTimid\n\n252 speed 252 SpAtk\n\nVacuum Wave, Aura Sphere, Flash Cannon, Nasty Plot.\n\nAdaptability bitch.  I'm gonna use Vacuum Wave.  Liiiiiiiiiike? Lucario. Why don't you fucking breed them yourself? YOU DON'T NEED A FUCKING 6IV DITTO TO BREED DUMBASS.  Vinny thinks he needs a 6IV Ditto to breed.  You don't need a 6IV Ditto to breed for IV and natures... You're just being lazy.  Why don't you breed like the rest of use without asking for people to do it for you? ALL THE GOOD IV POKEMON I HAVE WERE BRED BY ME.  Fuck you I'm using Arceus Fighting.  wut? Well that's about it for tonight people have a nice day.  Arceus-Fighting\n\nArceus-Fighting\n\nArceus-Fighting\n\nArceus-Fighting\n\nArceus-Fighting\n\nArceus-Fighting bai skrub frens Maybe I'll finally get a flair! :D Hey, that's not an official Smogon tier. It's just a tier made by some people on Smogon.  wjenmc 9ku dys46b*7(*&amp;(*M,*Ynm Turtle is a psychic type. I'm fighting type. MMMMMMM BITCH.  But psychic is within grasp of his little Turtle arms.  Yes he does. I had all kinds of different flairs, and I never actually had the spots. Hey Silver. You have a Keldeo right? deder than fuck.  Vinny where do you learn stuff about pokemon? Where do you go to learn about competitive pokemon, and stuff? I mean, do you do stuff like watch Verlisify? Gay.  Never mind I just thought that might be why you're bad.  Nah I think you don't have much skills.  And I didn't tell you.  It's K99's sex slave.  Good trainers know how to breed themselves good pokemon.  I didn't have any when I started breeding either.  Because I bred good IV pokemon, and then after I had my good IV pokemon bred I could use those.  With 2IV Pokemon I got from my friend safari's. No I didn't.  No you're abnormal.  Redneck phuck is more better than you at pokemon.  This is my theme. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpv5EGg18DM Guys, can someone help me make a paragraph of trash talk to put on my post when I get fighting? I only came up with one little line \"You better know what you're doing, because otherwise your Pokemon are going to die.\" Lord_Breloom's Breloom set is really OP AF isn't it? Breloom has the second most powerful Focus Punch in the game. The only thing that has a more powerful Focus Punch is Conkeldurr. But he doesn't have Spore so he can't really use it.  http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/regice\n\nGood god that special defense.  252 SpA Adaptability Mega Lucario Aura Sphere vs. 252 HP / 252+ SpD Regice: 160-192 (43.9 - 52.7%) -- 23.8% chance to 2HKO\n\n\nALL THAT SPECIAL BULK. Do you see the green above the \"tent\" in Omnipotent? It looks like a scary ass face, to me.  Why? ur poor liddle brain That green looks like a animal face!  I use commas correctly... Yes.  My logic is valid.  I want one that actually sounds serious.  Nope. I think I'll make something on my own.  I don't a big poem like everyone else.  I kind of don't want to have it be like the generic \"hello challenger, do you think you can beat me? I can assure you'll you'll never overcome my ??? type pokemon.\"  I'm not insane! :D Man I can't play as any of the smash characters except Lucario now. I don't know why. When I play with other characters it just feels like I can't move right, and shit.  Does it looks creepy? yah WHY IS ADEN SO GOOD? THIS DOES NOT COMPUTE.  No, I'm busy being raped by Sanic.  Wow Aden how did you come up with those Sanic combos? Those aren't anything like any combos I've ever seen a Sanic do before.  Itachi can't air dodge.  Godlag Hey Aden you, and Alex should do Sanic vs Sanic.  I fell off a cliff, and exploded.  Lol just because I'm fighting.  Sanic fell off a cliff, and exploded.  Weird. It wasn't lagging this much when it was just me, and Aden.\n\nAlso, it's weird how the lag just randomly stopped.  REST HIM!!! Jigglypuff flew into the sky, and exploded.  Why the hell was my aura so high? I was only at like 60%.  Kirby got hit by a kid covered in electricity and fell, and exploded.  Aden keep using Ness so I can heal you.  Nuuuuuuuuuuu! I'm not helping him! I wanna see Aden vs Alex.  SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR!!!!!!! It was only for one fight. And I didn't really heal him much.  I want a Keldeo for my fighting team. Would you happen to have one? Reddit: *Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!*\n\n I'm using Terrakion. Shit can I only have one? ( \u0361\u0298\u256d\u035c\u0296\u256e\u0361\u0298) Why the fuck does Reddit keep saying Ow? IT SAYS IT TO MMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! I want to play some smash Wii U.  Aden wanted Mono-Flying. Poor Aden. He can't get a spot.  No I don't.  Well I have two. One is a scarfed set, and the other is a bulky SR set.  ADEN. What?  Silver can clone it.  http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/types/ice\n\nThe last type you can get is probably Ice.  What Kyurem? I commented on one of your posts above.  y u use mega bannette instead of gengur? Verlisify is a furry! yah yah Because they know exactly what you're about to fucking do.  Yeah she was hot.  Anybody wanna make a black hole in smash 3DS? I haven't gotten to because no one will do it with me.  That doesn't make any fucking sense teeth are harder than rocks.  I'm board.  Did you battle him? What was it like when you battled? Was he like \"haw haw mah mons are bettur than urs! urs suck!\" or what? :( SUPER EFFECTIVE??? BUT I USED ROOST!!! Hax! Hax! Hax! Hax! Hax! Hax! Hax! Hax! Hax! GOD DAMN IT. God you suck.  USE SECRET SWORD ON MY CHANSEY. PLEASE.  INFILTRATOR!!!! YOU'RE JUST COUNTER TEAMING MY BRELOOM!!!! STUPID BAT.  FLINCH HAX IT TO DEATH!!! NNNOOOOO!!! D:&lt; I WANT FLINCH HAX!!! D:&lt; Yes.  NO SILVER!!!! KILL IT WITH ICE!!!! BRELOOMINATI!!!!! BULLSHIT.  BRELOOOOOOOOM!!!! BULLSHIT!!! That team was just stuff I wanted to use.  Well it didn't have any synergy. So.  Shut yo dumbass up.  Jolly, Iron Head, Ice Punch, Substitute, Thunder Wave. 252atk 252 speed because I didn't feel like re-EVing it. It was a scarf set but I didn't want it to be a scarf set.  Because there's no reason for you losing except that you have little skills.  I am too. What are you depressed about? I'm depressed that I can't make a good team with my Breloom. :( I know. I'm depressed because I suck at teambuilding.  What did he do when you beat him? Naw naw boi you use ubers.  Silver quick! Battle me! Give advice on team! uber noob Don't watch Yu-Gi-Oh. Play Yu-Gi-Oh.  Uber noob.  I'm battling Toshiro! Hahaha Toshiro has a Double Team Nincada. Good thing I have Skarmory.  Just goes to show how inexperienced you are. I challenged him because I couldn't find a battle.  Toshiro has Garchomp in against Metagross. \n\n*Uses Crunch instead of Earthquake* Toshiro is sitting here with his Slurpuff Drain Punching my Clefable. What the hell is this man doing? I know. But you don't have skill. It's Verlisify's set. He got enough HP to Belly Drum. Little did that dumbass know I have Unaware.  *Has Crobat in on Clefable* \n\n*Uses U-Turn* And there's the ragequit! Alright alright you have a little bit of skill.  Shut up I knew he was going to ragequit as soon as I challenged him! HOLY SHIT I FINALLY GOT MY DUELING NETWORK PASSWORD RIGHT!!! Because I wanted a skrub to kill.  That's not much.  I asked Toshiro why he ragequit. He said\n\n\n\n1. Because I can\n\n2. Cheap ass strategy\n\n3. I don't have time to battle people who use cookie cutter strategies.... Anyways, I might start playing VGC...\n\n Ok.  GAARA WINS!!! JK I've never watch Naruto.  *Toshiro spams Double Team*\n\n*Says Clefable is cheap* Does anyone here have an account on Dueling Network? Yeah lets do that.  Why? When I don't see Latias I feel like the page isn't loading right. :( Sure. DANE!!! JOIN MY GAME!!! Damn it. Why is it so hard to play with slow bulky characters like Charizard? Pick a stage without a moving background so it doesn't lag as much.  What? No way! I had the type advantage! Fuck Serperior.  It's a snake.  Yes I was Lucario, and Junito was Greninja.  yup I think I've gotten better. Do you think I've gotten better? Captain Dumbass.  I still can't really handle you, but at least I can hang on for a little bit now.  Junito selects his stage carefully.  Hey Junito I was messing around with the beanbag, and I think I might have made a combo for Lucario. Can you try it out for me? Hahaha Turtle is garbage with Ness.  I three stocked Dane! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! They call me Ronald McDonald.  If it's lagging for you it's lagging for me noob.  bai cya l8er Well I was right beside the sandbag, and then I short hopped and used my down air, and then I kept running to it(it barely went anywhere), and using my down air just before it hit the ground. Yes I'm good at Yugioh. Sorry guys. I wasn't here yesterday because I was playing Yugioh all day.  Ok, I fucking upvote everything. Click a link, come back, and all my upvotes are gone. What the fuck?! Hey guys. *Goes back to playing yugioh* Wasn't that in precambrian time? K99. Why, the actual fuck, does Vinny have a copy of my flair? Your dick is about to be shot.  Heat Wave? On? Flame birdy.  I'm ded, and watching card games on motorcycles. Flame birdy? But I'm watching card games on motorcycles.  What? They're just dumbasses don't worry.  Your ass is dumb.  Do any of you guys like card games on motorcycles? What was your team? DAMN ALL THAT CHOLESTEROL. ~~No fuck you.~~ No.  Why were you using those? It's not like you would have won if he didn't have ubers Aden.  Original&gt;5Ds&gt;GX&gt;Zexal&gt;that other new one.\n\nThen again I didn't watch GX so I'm just being racist, and stuff I guess.  muh favruts Me too. To me it seems like it's more exciting than the others for some reason.  D:  Me too, which is why I've been watching card games on motorcycles for the past couple of days.  If a youtuber breaks embargo? What the ban does that mean? Well obviously Nintendo, or whoever gave them the game will fuck them in the ass.  NO I WANNA WATCH CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES!!! ;( Yeah that golden Malamar looks like shit.  Gotta be a cruel phaggot.  It's God.  What are you talking about? Of course they did. You whore. I was in the middle of watching card games on motorcycles.  Hey you should tell Jamie to ban that girl named Woopkip who blocked you. I don't like her.  I don't. Maybe if you didn't suck at life you'd know that by now.  What the ban is a jab cancel? No trolling doesn't mean anything. It's just an activity that takes advantage of dumbasses.\n\n I don't have a fucking idea. What the the fuck do YOU think a Jab Cancel is? ***IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!!!!!*** No it doesn't. So if I troll someone then I don't care about how people feel? Yeah.   Ok I guessed that, but what the fuck does canceling your jabs do? For fun.  Obviously.  Cool. I'm a troll. So that means I don't care about other people's feelings.  Because it's fun. And I'm not the one trolling right now.  According to Vinny. He said that trolling means you don't care about other people's feelings.  Cyber bullying isn't really bullying. It's not bullying if you can easily make it stop.  Boooooo, shut up.  Just because I have fun by annoying people doesn't make me a bad person. You think I'm a bad person because I annoy people once in a while? They can make it stop. It's called turn off the computer. \n\nI've never had any trouble with the police because I'm not a bad person.  I'm in a mood to watch card games on motorcycles.  Stop what? I'm not doing anything. &gt;A good person never annoys anyone ever.\n\n~Vinny No shits given. You can easily get away from people \"cyber bullying\" you. There aren't. Yes you can. You can turn off your computer, or whatever you're getting cyber bullied on.  Yeah that fukcing bully. He should get banned.  NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! PAT HAS NEVER ANNOYED ANYONE!!! EVER!!!! I'M NOT TRYING TO BAN ANYONE DUMBASS HOE.  How does that apply to this? Yes it does. Turn off your computer, and it all instantly stops.  BY BULLYING PEOPLE YOU FUCKING HYPOCRITE!!!!!!! I know one thing. Turn off the computer, and the internet goes away.  YOU'RE ANNOYING US.  Yeah, but I don't see how that applies to this.  I know that, stupid.  It's because you act like a dumbass more than anyone else.  I didn't mean it's actually gone. But it's gone for the person getting \"bullied\".  BY BULLYING.  I'm the best at taunting.  Except you don't have to get back on the site.  No I'm going back to watching card games on motorcycles.  I can point it out if I want.  Are you fucking kidding me? You don't have to use facebook.  &gt;Yes, because everyone can just quit stuff like FaceBook, It's easier to quit smoking.\n\n~Vinny\n\n You could always stop being a dumbass.  What? Why? UJFJWJKJX&lt;O W YOU'RE SO FUCKING STUPID VINNYUIUMU&lt;&gt;)*&amp;NM^&amp; Normal person? Except I'm not being like a stupid class bully who makes fun of someone over something like a pimple.  Of cool, I hate when faggots taunt.  No they're true. I said people can get away from \"cyber bullying\" by getting off the website, and you're like \"but peoples wanna get on fucebiik D:\". I obey the rules. SO I'm a normal person right? Except you're being a dumbass when you're not actually a dumbass.  Oh really? They don't have that rule at my school.  I WAS GOING TO HAVE JAMIE DO IT. NOT ME.  I love how you're all like \"you'll see, some day...\" like you're going to do something to us some day.  Yup.  i luv chips They'd lose healer. So with Aromatherpy/Heal Bell they could only get rid of 8 Toxics.  I agree Turtle buddy.  Original Character, or something.  That moment when you're watching youtube on your 3DS, and you skip back to the middle of the video while trying to clean your screen.  1. Because you're right, and they didn't. \n\n2. Because they're dumbasses like that.  Victory Star Pikachu, yay... Well I think it's about time to quit pokemon.  NEVER!!!!! Silver thinks it's legit. Turtle thinks it's a troll. As much as a choice scarf. A Dragon Dance is a +1 boost, and a +1 is 1.5 times higher than your speed stat. Shouldn't you know this? \n\n329x1.5=493 inb4 Flash Cannon, and Aura Sphere. It's give you x1.5.  *Quits competitive* It's shit anyway. Your internet was the one that was in the red.  Oh shit... Yup, Talonfucked.  http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/medicham\n\nhttp://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/alakazam\n\nLook at their attack stats.  In the thing that shows who's online. No that my internet is great, but I think yours was causing more trouble than mine.  *Everything Look it up. It can't miss you idiot.  It can't miss stupid.  Sorry, it's just that around here if you say something stupid everybody fucks you up over it.  Lets do that.  We need that Mega Pidgeot.  :( I'm sure one of the shitty mods around here can manage to get him a Mega Pidgeot flair.  Who? Why not? Damn. Sucks doesn't it? I have no more episodes of card games on motorcycles to watch. ;( I guess it's back to the good old days of sitting on the computer all day upvoting all the posts.  im back from the ded im back from the ded ;) Good times. Did you guys notice I was gone? ;( Well of course you would notice because you weren't getting a constant stream of upvotes.  And kicks your mother fucking ass. ~~I'm here to kick your ass.~~ I'm here because there's no more episodes of card games on motorcycles for me to watch all day.  That reminds me. When I went outside today I saw my cat.  Foolish fags... Did you see my idea that I posted on Miiverse? Also, who were you fighting for fire? But turtles aren't suppose to be sanic. :0 He was scarfed. :0 hackaturdle Then how the fuck did he have a scarfed zard y? Just admit it. I'm your favorite person.  But SOMEBODY said something about a scarf.  shofu, obviously.  I can't exactly downvote him. Yup yup.  WEENIE BEASTS!!! Yup yup.  ~~I wanna be cards games on motorcycles.~~\n\n~~I'm proud of my gigantic dick.~~\n\nI'm bored AF. Luckily I ~~'ed it out so I didn't say it. I'm safe.  Same with me.  Do you guys watch Danger Dolan? JELLY BEANS OF COVERED IN BUG SHIT!!! The Hero of Hyrule is my dick. tru YYYEEEEEESSS!!!! &gt;:D I am getting a fucking degree in hamburgerology.  Hell freezes over every winter. You learn more shit every day. Some dumbasses.  You know what I learned? That you learned that I watch Matthew Santoro.  Hey guys what's poppin? So what happened with Aden this time? HACKER!!!!!!!11111110ne0ne0ne Where'd everyone go? Why is it everyone randomly leaves? all y u so paralz\n OOOOOHHH all tried to EQ my skarm get bitched rek huehuehue im so smart and predicty Obviously.  no Not exactly. It wasn't really hax. I just didn't really have anything to deal with Thundurus.  Funfact: all is the only person online in ORAS who will battle.  Not really because it never paralyzed me.  I didn't say it meant anything, I just said that because it was funny.  He's a scrub don't battle him.  No.  No, mine is Sand Rush.  No he's just garbage.  Ewwww VGC. Are there any good teambuilders out there? IDK you guys seem pretty even to me. I sometimes struggle against Aden because he'll have stuff I can barely deal with.  Who are they? I need a god damn team with my sub punch Breloom. I've been trying to make one since the beginning of ORAS, and I can't make a good one.  Thanks for the useless copy paste.  7.8/10. Too much able to get fucked up by Thundurus.  Yeah. Sure BTW they call me lag.  Why is it that when I come back to playing smash it feels like I can't do stuff right? It feels like my stuff does happen fast enough.  Yeah but he gives me trouble.  5429-6798-5630 But what about LAGLAGLGALGALGLALGLALG Hey was I just dreaming or did Aden beat Silver(at smash) sometime in the past? Cuz if so I'm now scured of Aden.  I learned how to spot dodge.  Scrubtachi get on smash.  I thought people wanted to play smash.  Why is it they had to make it so Meta Knight couldn't recover if he used a special and ended up off the stage? They call me lag.  Fuck him up Dane! That's what it is.  But it's hard to use him now. :( I will dine on turtle soup tonight. I don't, I just want to.  Or maybe we're both gonna be at Dane's buffet.  Get rekt Turtle.  Yeah.  Oh no it's Jigglypuff! It's tiiiiiime to spa-spa-spa-spa-spa-spa-spa-spa-SPAM!!! Itachi I wanted to gang up on Turtle with you, but nooooo you have to kill him yourself.  I'm talking about in smash. hai NO I FORGOT TO CHANGE MY STAGE TO FD MODE!!! I'm prurtecting Dane then.  Then why'd you say that? Make me a team with my SubPunch Breloom.  Intense lag fight with Itachi. I'm not doing that. Itachi r8 my skill m8. What the fuck was that? Why'd it make me fucking fly right into Dane's tree? DANE MURDER THE TURTLE.  Guys we have to kill Turtle.  And that my godly proskills are useless without a good team.  I accidentally flew into Danes tree and died, and then Turtle killed me, but it's fine because he got rekt in the next match and then everyone quit.  I will dine on turtle soup tonight.  That wasn't a good team.  I was dead. I was telling them to kill turtle.  I can't, every time I do they fail.  I'm done trying to kill turtle, I'll try to kill Silver.  Somebody in Silver's room is scared of me.  Who could it be? I bet it's Turtle who's scared because I rekt him so much in Itachi's room.  Turtle is scared of me now. He won't let me join Silver's room.  It's definitely turtle.  Or maybe Silver's scared that I'll beat him so he won't let me join.\n\nEDIT: Turtle is scared confirmed.   I was just kidding.  Yah Silver is afraid. OOOOUUUUUUUUUUUU BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Turtle is mad that I rekt him confirmed.  Wanna play smash since Turtle is too scared to let  me into Silver's room? That happened in your smash room with me, you Dane, and Turtle.  A few days ago I was laying in my bed watching youtube, and I hit my elbow on the wall. And I'm sure you guys know how that feels, but it was worse because for some reason my arm started cramping too. It was weird.  You're mad that I'm better than you at smash.  Explain.  I've never seen him as an asshole, just a dumbass.  No! &gt;:( Why the fuck did it make me come up at an angle?! I'm not on reddit when I fight. I'm on reddit in between.  Why is it that everyone acts like Aden is bad at smash? Aden do you wanna do some ledge fighting?  Turtle is scared of me, remember?  I'm better than Itachi confirmed.  I JUST BEAT ADEN THE SANIC!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well I've had enough smash for now.  2Pro4U *Goes to pokemon* stahp the purn Lets have our mons clash in an epic battle of skill, luck, and trickery.  FIGHT ME. Fight me.  FIGHT ME.  Sure. Let me find some things.  Ok I've got this Tornadus. Take it, and make it's SpAtk 252, make it's speed 252, and clone one for yourself while you're at it. BTW, you know what you're doing with that PS right? Oh god.... This isn't good.  Somebody needs to teach him how to use it. It's fine, I threw mine together too. Aden the legend scrub.  Cool, now lets see if using powersaves helped you.  Godshroom is about to kill Aden.  Go stealth racks. Go cherzaerd Well Aden has more mons, but I'm starting to break through his team.  Aden why bring out your Pidgeot on my Chansey instead of that Life Orb Latios? Lyfe Orb Latios Psyshock.  truu Preducktion. Chansey is a murderererer.  It's time to Softboiled.  Beware the crit.  DOUBLE CRIT.  YES LIVE LIVE LIVE THAT SPECIAL BULK ON THE PHYSICAL HIPPOWDON.  NO!! WEAKLING HIPPO!! NO!!! WEAKLING BRELOOM!! No.  It's just that scrubhippo, and Breloom can't beat Latios.  ..... I thought there'd be more of a shitstorm.  You.  Since a lot of people here seem to hate you I thought there might be a shitstorm over you beating me.  Hey K99 what happened with the old phaggot who told the police lies about you? That's right they better fucking apologize.  That just makes P!mpkrow an even better name.  OH MY GOD THAT IS FUCKING TERRIBLE YOU CHANGE GENDERS THAT IS FUCKING DISGUSTING.  It's fucking disgusting too.  Rollrest.  Is one of them Wally? I saw a guy who had a Wally icon.  You're much worse than Aden.  I love how Breloom's resisted Focus Punch still does more than a Rock Tomb. Lies.  Hey Itachi your mono poison sucks.  Why showdown when you have in-game? Itachi's mono-poison is getting run over by Breloom's new squad.  When in doubt spam Soft-Boiled.  What the fuck? Damn, Itachi's Mega Beedrill's Knock Off didn't do a thing to my Chansey.  But we're already battling so it's kind of pointless.  dum itachi used Earth Power on my Breloom Yes you are. I'm not joking.  I beat Itachi. Aden beat me. \n\n\nItachi&lt;Me&lt;Aden\n\nlol I think Itachi thought that his Tentacruel could wall out my Breloom. \n\nItachi does not understand the power of Breloom.  Except Vinny. Yeah, but seriously. Aden is much harder to beat than you.  My team had nothing to stop his Latios is couldn't help it. It was just once.  Oh I get it. \n\nTy&lt;Aden\n\nItachi&lt;Ty\n\nAden&lt;Itachi I can beat Aden. I've probably beaten Aden more than anyone else here.  skrub No I battled Vinny a couple of times before, Aden is easily better than him.  But Focus Punch.  No fuck Bowen.  But I just got off pokemon, and went to smash bros. :( Except Ty. And Silver. ~~And Aden.~~ But IDGAF it 2HKOs anyway.  But I was already gone.  Adamant.  Guys. I can't take this anymore Aden vs Vinny right now. \n\nGotta show you guys that Vinny is no match for Aden.  It didn't have a team. It was just stuff I felt like using.  No I'm only about that 3DS version.  You'd battle him wouldn't you? Why is it the fucking CPUs roll so much? Now we just need Aden.  ADEN!!! No.  Drunken Skrub.  Does any of you guys want to do a black hole in smash 3DS with me?  I went into my kitchen and said \"I wanna cookie\" my mom said \"Why?\" . I watched a video a while back of StylesX2 doing one. I don't know if it was in Wii U, or 3DS but it happened.  We don't give a fuck, you stupid fucking bot! I asked for another cookie, and my mom gave me potato chips. Dafuq? Guys, ban NNID: AFC-HATER Yeah you're right we don't need to ban that false reporter.  Alright we need one more person.  I thought I was gonna puke yesterday. I was really hungry when I got home from school so I ate a bunch.  Yes him. Who else? That's what happens when you're a fatass.  *Shoots your dick* k NOOOOOO. Ok. Maybe we won't need Itachi.  That's the spirit. Destroy hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiim! You get migraines in your ass? What the fuck? Alright scrubs. If you're participating in the black hole comment here telling what you'll do. \n\nI'm being a Lucario.  Two Lucarios. One Captain Falcon(on the Lucario team). And one Sanic to get trapped in the black hole. The sanic must lightly punch the lucarios until they're at almost 200%(so they'll have max aura). Then the Lucarios stands back to back and charge up Aura spheres. THe sanic dies, and when he respawns he falls into the black hole then gets rekt. Captain Falcon uses Falcon Pawnch on those little sun item things that fly around the stage(so we need that item). When he pawnches them they expand and he throws them into the black hole.  Ok you be captain falcon. Join me, and Alex. And join my team.  You'll have to be Lucario.  Yeah I know. I just wanna trap Sanic in the black hole.  If we fuck up the black hole we'll try again, ok? You're gonna be the Sanic right? SO Nick will be CAptain FLacon, and we'll have Dane be a Lucario.  Dane join our room and pick Lucario. We're on the 3DS BTW.  gud Sorry, we replaced you with Dane.  PICK BLUE. I hope you guys know how this works.  THATS WHAT YOUR JOB IS. I SAID GET US TO 200%. SCRUB. Nick get them sun things on the other side too.  This is fun.  Aw man I wanted him to get to 999%. :( Try again. Get our auras higher this time.  Hahaha Alex died.  Hey Dane. I think it works better if you're facing the opposite direction of me.  God damn my screen is shaking.  Alex, suicide so you can get right in the middle.  Again again! :D Jigglypuff. It doessn't really matter. Just try again.  DAMNIT ALEX.  DON'T KILL HIM.  Ok  now get up Dane.  Dane you can start now.  Why the fuck is Dane's aura higher than mine? HOLY SHIT DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT.  When me, and Dane were first charging there was a giant Aura sphere for a second. Did you guys see it? Fucking amazing.  Lets see if we can deplete all of Alex's stocks.  Alex has fallen into a black hole, and can't get out.  He's not dying. I spoke too soon.  Aw man it's lagging. :( That was fun. I wanna do it again.  We need a new Captain Falcon.  Now Dane is the Sanic/Jigglypuff.  And Alex is a Lucario.  lol Do you have smash 3DS? Nevermind Nick came back.  DON'T KILL ME DANE. JUST HURT ME A LOT.  Shit... You could replace someone if they quit.  What do you mean? Ok guys don't start with those little sun things until we're gonna start the black hole.  Hey, lets try one with no aura.  Do you think our black hole could cause any lag? What character can do a lot of damage, but can do it without killing? Fox(with lasers). Dane should shoot us as Fox.  I'LL BE RED.  Dane you're Blue again.  Dane you'll be a Lucario next time.  We dun fucked up.  NICK\n\n GUYS I'M BEING THE GUY IN THE BLACK HOLE NEXT.  We finally got it right. Now I can put my spamming to good use.  Why aren't you guys communicating here? There'd be less problems if we talked.  I'm gonna try something when I die. I'll jump in while I have invincibility, and use my reflector, and see what happens.  Hahaha you guys got annihilated when I turned on my reflector in the black hole.  Hey Vinny if you're still here you can join because Nick left.  I sort of wanna test out some thing on the black hole now.  DAMN IT I HIT START.  Turtle help us with the black hole.  Nevermind Nick joined.  PK Fire spam with Ness is way faster than lasers with Fox.  Wait nevermind Dane quit. Pick Captain Falcon.  I think Dane might have been causing the lag because his internet was red with 0 bars.  This is actually kind of hilarious.  yah fur real There you go get me right inside.  This is a good black hole.  Ok Turtle when I'm at 999 take a thing, and throw it acrosss the stage. Not even into the black hole just across the stage.  THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING DUMBASS. IT'S JUST THAT I'M TRYING TO TYPE ON REDDIT AT THE SAME TIME.  This is why I main Lucario.  Holy shit there's constant lightning bolts! I'm gonna be Fox next because I love turning on the reflector when I'm in the black hole.  Turtle when I'm in the aura sphere throw a thing so it circles the stage. I wanna see what it does with the aura sphere.  Will you guys fucking stop it, and let me get your percentages up? What was that?  That's what I was doing.  Damn. Faster Nick! Malamar is fucking cool. It just has some bug weaknesses.  I think there's sweetspots for the aura or something. Because I've had a stronger aura than this at lower percentages.  I read that already.  Turtle run back so we can see it zoomed out.  Ok lets get to 170%.  I wanna be the blue guy next.  I WANNA BE RED. I wanna be Falcon next ok? I haven't been Falcon yet.  Turtle just shoot.  Turtle jump in and turn on your reflector.  Lets try it! But I don't think the suns will reflect.  When the music starts, and the screen is still black you know shit is fucked up.  I'm a Fox.  Now you gonna be Ronald McDonald.  Is this gonna turn into \"test stuff in smash\"? Cause I'm fine with that.  Who stole my Wifi?  Ok I'll be a Lucario two of you be Fox.  Guys stand apart so I can get out of the way. It needs to be an aura sphere because the suns disapere.  Turn off items too. I don't want a sun to spawn inbetween the reflectors, and stop the sphere.  Do you guys wanna do the reflector thing, or not? k I couldn't get out of the way because some Foxs were too close together.  Ok guys here's the plan. Turtle stands on one side. Alex stands on the other side. Ok? Stand farther fucking apart so I can get out of the way before te aura sphere comes back.  Here's the problems I'm having. \n\n1. I can't get out of the way in time because you guys are too close. \n\n2. Nick keeps fucking shit up.  NO I DON'T. I CAN'T JUMP OUT OF THE WAY IN TIME.  1. Do you wanna try it? Ok I think Lucario's lag after shooting the sphere is too high. I'm gonna use someone else.  Haha turtle died. DOES PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDS HOW THIS WORKS? Ok Alex. Let one more person join so there won be a 4th guy getting in the way.  WHY'D I GET HIT? My reflector is broken. Ok so after 3 reflects Samus' blast breaks through the reflector. Want to try another characters projectile? Nah.  Wait nick. Use an uncharged blast.  Sure. Hey Nick, after this be Fox, and shoot a laser. We can probably reflect that a lot.  Wait a minute guys BRB.  We've been fucking around on smash for like 3 hours Hey lets reflect a little Megaman Lemon.  By guys. I guess that's enough having fun with bullshit for one day. \n\nBut we should make another black hole tomorrow.  Guys lets make another black hole. We need two more guys. Who are they? ded You still need to battle Aden.  I didn't know you guys were here.  Do you think you can beat him? Ok.  Scrub.  Get fucked.  I'll be there in 10 minutes.  Probably.  I wanna be an Ostrich Jockey when I grow up.  Find them. CALM!!! Make me a Technician Breloom.  BATTLE VINNY!!!! And why did you leave reddit? Just a standard Technician Breloom with a Focus Sash.  Yeah that's good.  I can be Ganondorf right? http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/hydreigon No. I'm not fucking doing that. Just find it yourself.  You ain't getting jack shit.  IDK do you think it would be good if Cofagrigus could up it's defense? It's not like you actually lose anything.  What? Don't you put the apostrophe there to show ownership? I'm not a grammar so I don't know.  And I'm not a fucking idiot I know it's is a contraction of 'it is'.  And I start my sentences with whatever I fucking what to start them with.  Anybody wanna play smash? Not if grammar doesn't wanna get it's ass kicked.  Bowser Jr? You wanna smash bro? Ok. How do I know what pokemon are day? Mixed Mega Charizard Y.  It died. So now I'm gonna play with turtle. Well I've gotta defeat turtle in smash. Wish me luck.  Smash is so much different when you aren't attacking only one person.  I'm fine with customs, they make things more interesting.  I have the actual black hole aura sphere. It actually sucks you in.  tru Ganondorf got rekt by my black hole aura spheres.  I know. I fucking love it.  Itachi. Did we just get rekt by a CPU? I murdered Itachi with them. He was Ganondorf so he couldn't get away from them.  No turtle came back. Customs are on BTW.  But there was a CPU replacing you.  I WIN!!! YOU SUCK!!! Hey Itachi next time try reflecting those thorons.

Once they noticed some people showed off by tipping they got a law passed saying they could pay wait staff crap because tips would cover the rest and that some how wait staff would make more. Not my fault if someone decided to get a job that pays shit. I did my time in fast food and did more work than waiters without tips. Tipping is something that needs to stop. Plus in america if a waiter doesn't make federal minimum wage after tips their employer is required to pay them federal minimum wage. It isn't actually fucking them over that is just how some want us to think about it. Why is it my responsibility to drop my earnings for their choices? Why not tip for everything?\n\nEdit: down votes won't change the truth. If you tip you are part of the problem, if you feel for food servers maybe work to make it so they get better wages not keep a toxic system going. No they don't. The law requires if they don't make federal minimum after tips they still make federal minimum. That is exactly what it will do. If we shift wage accountability back to the employer and not random people who tip random amounts it will go back to what most of the world does. Or wait staff can understand it started as gratuity not obligation to pay your bills. Maybe they should follow proper tipping laws. That isn't on me. Actually people do choose where they work by where they apply. Stop being ignorant and pedantic at the same time. It shouldn't be on the consumer to cover wages. Most of the world understands that. Time for the states to get with the program and stop getting tricked by a business. Not my fault if people choose to be employed by huckesters that made it legal to violate wage laws. Minimum wage is what lots of people make. I get that it isn't easy but why should I be accountable for their choices. Sure I wish we lived in a world where everyone could just make it, but down here with the 99% I don't have the assets to make a difference unless everyone else works for it to. Tipping is only helping a system that doesn't work  Do you tip fast food? If not shut the fuck up Nah they just take your order, make it, take it to you. Either you tip all servers are you are just another holier than thou hypocritical bitch trying to shame me for not agreeing with your bad move. Tipping already has little to do with actual quality and more to do with basic psychology tricks and bias. Don't bash me because I don't bother with a bad practice. Not really. We have it. Traffic laws, registration. Critical thinking do you haz it...appear not. Oh noes bars, wait I don't need to drink. I checked your history to see if you were a troll or just stupid. Guess which I found. Not I. The same way as tipping. See in other careers if you don't like your pay, ask for a raise. Wait staff blame customers for low tips, not themselves for low service, nor are they inclined to ask for a raise. Tipping isn't even by numbers based on service but again a series of human reactions like if they touch you, repeating your name, and crouching down. If we remove tipping business will have the responsibility back on them and you won't see as much discrimination- example lots of wait staff have admitted to not liking to wait on minorities because they tip less. However do they tip less because they know they aren't preferred clients? Again tipping is toxic to society. In replies to others I have covered all of the logical and reasonable factors in the decision. Yeah it isn't popular, currently, but so have a lot of really good things. Tipping puts a lot on the customer instead of the employer which is a blame shift for wages. I don't see why we as a culture let them pull this shit. Anything starts with awareness. This is why I admit to clearly unliked stance. Even if it isn't yet where it will make a difference some people need to admit that a practice that by its very nature can't be done without bias needs to stop and society needs to remember why pretty much every business is responsible for wages rather than direct client. Why should you have to deal with a bitter sulky wait staff because last week you needed gas money but wanted a decent meal after a hard day of work? If someone in basically any career aside from waiting has wage issues they go to their employer. Now we have wait staff splitting tips even with servers that had jack to do with earning the tip and other sides of the business that make normal wages as some \"fair\" practice. Tipping just gets more toxic over time. When I am very open about my reasoning I can only assert that people citing me being cheap or an asshole are merely unable to read at a third grade level. Sure in day to day a waiter might think it is about them but in general I rarely go out. Having young kids even before I stopped tipping service was horrid. Wait staff tends to treat people with kids as something loathed and horrid. It was part of what lead me to look at studies on tipping, because there had to be a reason for this night and day switch in behavior and it turn out there was way more to it including studies suggesting tipping is not a good practice.", "topic_full": "football game sure lol play win team didn shit cowboys", "label": "Shrikeangel", "topic_id": "topic_4", "topic_distr": [0.00023261237904080765, 0.00023261775175742499, 0.079420358024321319, 0.00023260662557551319, 0.5391540801857454, 0.00023261119160407858, 0.0002326034757439613, 0.3797972859190758, 0.000232610572258309, 0.00023261387487747418], "mean_infl": 0.0005139060464261896}], ["Ocula", {"topic_repr": "football game sure", "text": " Having your plans cancelled that you were really looking forward to.

If I do smell and don't notice it myself, my mom will point it out to me (she smells as good as a bloodhound and is not embarrassed to tell me when I stink) and then I'll wash myself. I don't sweat a lot (I don't live in a warm country) and don't have a very strong body odor.

Ditto :) Well, I am from Europe :) Does it surprise you that I'm European? :p  \nI know some people that shower every day, but most people just shower if they need to. It's not part of a strict routine. I don't workout a lot and the day of the workout is often my shower day. I don't sweat a lot, which helps. Nope, European :) I don't think it is. I do make sure I'm clean, but not by showering or bathing every day. It's quite normal where I come from. The minute I start to smell a little bit, my mom will tell me to wash myself. Don't even need to ask her. It's the same with me. I don't sweat a lot and cleaning my armpits and intimate areas with water at the sink does the trick on my non-shower days. I depends from person to person. I have friends that need to shower everyday and others that don't need to. I keep my hygiene in check, but I think showering/bathing are not the only options when it comes to taking care of yourself. I don't wait until someone tells me. There were a few people commenting that I might not know if I smell bad or not. So I tried to explain that it's rather impossible for me to walk around stinking.
